[NOISE]. Hey 2
<br><br>well done on getting to the end of the first proper teaching section. 3
<br><br>We have learned a whole load about basic C#. 4
<br><br>We've done variables, we've done conditionals, 5
<br><br>two different types, if statements and switch statements. 6
<br><br>We've talked about functions in quite a lot of detail. 7
<br><br>There's a few notable admissions of course. 8
<br><br>You didn't learn something that would return parameters in C#. 9
<br><br>We'll learn those in future sections. 10
<br><br>There's a whole load stuff actually that we haven't really got into. 11
<br><br>Like floating point value types. 12
<br><br>We eluded to them but we never really used them. 13
<br><br>There's a whole bunch of things you didn't do but 14
<br><br>let's congratulate on what you did do and this is giving you a great foundation. 15
<br><br>Now we purposefully didn't go into unity too much In this section, 16
<br><br>really at all because the purpose of it is to give you a foundation in C#. 17
<br><br>Now, there's some ideas as to how you can improve this game and 18
<br><br>really make it your own. 19
<br><br>You could add more difficulty levels of the game. 20
<br><br>You could add a whole load of you of new words, but 21
<br><br>you can also reskin in the entire game to be a different type of gamer. 22
<br><br>I'd be really interested in hat you can come up with there. 23
<br><br>So at this stage you've kind of got two options. 24
<br><br>One is that you spend more time polishing this game, or 25
<br><br>the other is you just move straight on into the next section now to keep 26
<br><br>the momentum and just do whatever you prefer. 27
<br><br>Because remember, once you've picked up more skills in the next section 28
<br><br>you can always come back to this game and 29
<br><br>continue to pour more things into it when you've learned some more tools. 30
<br><br>So whichever you prefer, but please, just keep the momentum, 31
<br><br>cuz remember that action creates clarity sometimes. 32
<br><br>So just moving forward, 33
<br><br>just doing something is really the most important thing. 34
<br><br>So whatever is most likely to keep you moving, do it. 35
<br><br>Either add to this game now to push their boat out and 36
<br><br>go the extra mile, or move on to the next section, and I can't wait to see 37
<br><br>the results of what you create, whichever you decide to do at this point.
