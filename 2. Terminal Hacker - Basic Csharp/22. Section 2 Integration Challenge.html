[MUSIC] 2
<br><br>By the end of this slightly longer than usual video, 3
<br><br>we will have a lovely third difficulty level. 4
<br><br>In my case, NASA and some more ASCII [INAUDIBLE] code will have all been 5
<br><br>tidied and touched and improved, so see you [INAUDIBLE] then. 6
<br><br>First thing I'm gonna wanna do here is actually give the player a hint. 7
<br><br>They've got no chance of guessing the password right now, and 8
<br><br>there's a very easy way of giving the player a hint. 9
<br><br>I've provided you with a very simple function. 10
<br><br>If I can just find the right place in the code here. 11
<br><br>Where it says please enter your password,. I'm just gonna simplify that down to 12
<br><br>enter your password cuz we haven't got a lot of width on the screen, 13
<br><br>and then I'm gonna say hint colon. 14
<br><br>Now the way we're gonna generate a hint is to concatenate to this string. 15
<br><br>So we can have enter your password space, and 16
<br><br>then a new string is gonna be generated by saying password.Anagram. 17
<br><br>This is a method that we've provided for you. 18
<br><br>It's one of a good implementation. 19
<br><br>It doesn't even work if the password is blank, 20
<br><br>it causes an error, but it does the job. 21
<br><br>When you have a valid password set, 22
<br><br>which you will do by the time you get to this point in the code. 23
<br><br>And if you say password.Anagram, 24
<br><br>the result of that expression is a new password shuffled. 25
<br><br>That's all you need to know. 26
<br><br>So password.Anagram, let's try it. 27
<br><br>This gives a lot of meat to the game because suddenly, 28
<br><br>you're in a situation where you choose a level and your password. 29
<br><br>You see now we've actually got a game to play, if I get it wrong, sorry, 30
<br><br>wrong password. 31
<br><br>Arguably it ought to ask us again and again and again with different hints. 32
<br><br>So let's just make a modification for that. 33
<br><br>What we gonna do, instead of when we check the password we get it wrong, 34
<br><br>instead of saying sorry, wrong password,. I'm just gonna go start game again. 35
<br><br>Restart the game, 36
<br><br>and then I'm gonna question whether start game is the right name. 37
<br><br>It's not really, so we can rename the method, 38
<br><br>remember the rename tool could be ask for password like so. 39
<br><br>All right, and then I notice that ask for 40
<br><br>password is doing too much, because this block in there is too visually dense. 41
<br><br>So I pull that out and say that what we're really doing there is set. 42
<br><br>RandomPassword with one a. 43
<br><br>That's the type of thinking. I'm trying to get you into. 44
<br><br>Don't need the word private. 45
<br><br>Okay, so just to recap what we did there, we said okay, 46
<br><br>let's just make check password even simpler, 47
<br><br>we only display the win screen and we ask for the password again. 48
<br><br>And as for password, we take a whole lump of code out to keep it simpler. 49
<br><br>And then we've used an anagram system to shuffle the password up. 50
<br><br>Inside the implementation of that of course, 51
<br><br>it uses a type of Random.Range that we're using here. 52
<br><br>I just thought I'd spare you the details for this section. 53
<br><br>Anyway, let's try the game flow now. 54
<br><br>One, not sure. 55
<br><br>Okay, shelf, now. 56
<br><br>I'll have a book. 57
<br><br>I think I must have typed shelf wrong there, let's just test again tfnr. 58
<br><br>I'm gonna cheat, that's pathetic isn't it font. 59
<br><br>I have a book. 60
<br><br>I'm not sure quite what happened there but. I think the game is running okay. 61
<br><br>I'm gonna pause the video and check the recording and 62
<br><br>see if we did have a bug or not. 63
<br><br>A tool I have available to me. 64
<br><br>What fun,. I've looked back at the recording and 65
<br><br>when I thought I typed shelf,. I actually had typed shelf. 66
<br><br>But the problem is that the word in the dictionary, 67
<br><br>well done if you spotted this before, has been self all the way along. 68
<br><br>A valid word but not in the same theme. 69
<br><br>So that's what went wrong there, so there wasn't a bug. 70
<br><br>All right, so is this game flow okay now, let's try level two. 71
<br><br>Maybe to restart the game as I made code change. 72
<br><br>Let's try level two, this one is holasdf, if I get it wrong, 73
<br><br>it goes there, okay, cool. 74
<br><br>If I get it right, it goes to the win screen, awesome. 75
<br><br>Now the next thing I want to do is to challenge you to tidy 76
<br><br>up your code yourself. 77
<br><br>I wanna make sure that in your code, whatever you've got to, 78
<br><br>each function should only do one thing. 79
<br><br>So I've just done that for my StartGame(), but 80
<br><br>please make sure your functions are short and clear. 81
<br><br>I also want you to introduce a thing where the user should be reminded they can type 82
<br><br>menu at any time where that's appropriate to know that. 83
<br><br>When you feel like it's not obvious they should type menu, then give them a hint, 84
<br><br>but don't repeat yourself. 85
<br><br>So try and put that hint about, you can type 86
<br><br>menu at any time somewhere that you only need to define it once in the code. 87
<br><br>And if you are not sure, will take a backup zip of your file first. 88
<br><br>So go ahead, pause the video, take a look at your own code, get ownership of it. 89
<br><br>Make sure you are comfortable with it, rename things as necessary. 90
<br><br>Make it feel yours and. I'll be back in a minute. 91
<br><br>Okey dokey, so I am just going to put in a variable up here to start with and 92
<br><br>then I'm gonna talk about a refinement of that. 93
<br><br>I'm gonna say string, and then I'm gonna call this, 94
<br><br>what should I call it, what is it? 95
<br><br>It's a menu hint, I think. 96
<br><br>So menu hint equals, and then we're gonna come in and say you may type and 97
<br><br>I'm putting it up here because I want to be able to use it in multiple places. 98
<br><br>You may type menu at anytime. 99
<br><br>All right, and then semi colon on the end. 100
<br><br>Now, when do I want to print this menuHint? 101
<br><br>Well, let's play the game and see. 102
<br><br>I don't really need to say it here cuz we're at the menu but there it would be 103
<br><br>useful just after we've asked for the password, so please choose a valid level. 104
<br><br>Maybe there as well actually,. Terminal.WriteLine menuHint, okay? 105
<br><br>Because if we keep choosing valid levels off the bottom of the screen, 106
<br><br>then that would comp and help us. 107
<br><br>Please enter password, let's put it there as well. 108
<br><br>So what I've done is I have to find a string at the top which we can use in 109
<br><br>multiple places. 110
<br><br>What else, have a book, got a prison key, okay. 111
<br><br>Whatever happens at the end of the show level reward, 112
<br><br>I think after that what you want to do is to write menu hint as well. 113
<br><br>So their the places I'm deciding to put it. 114
<br><br>Let's see how my game feels like that, then I'm gonna introduce you to one more 115
<br><br>concept and then I think we are good to go. 116
<br><br>So let's play the game. 117
<br><br>Enter your selection. 118
<br><br>If I have put some rubbish in, 119
<br><br>please use a valid level you can type menu with anytime. 120
<br><br>The good thing about that is if I'm right down here, I can still type menu. 121
<br><br>Number one. 122
<br><br>You can type menu at anytime, so again, if I keep re-missing or I wanna give up, 123
<br><br>I can just type menu and if I get it right like borrow, 124
<br><br>I think that one's borrow. 125
<br><br>You may type menu at anytime. 126
<br><br>Awesome, all right, so that's really helped with the flow of my game. 127
<br><br>I like that.. So hopefully, 128
<br><br>you've done something very similar in yours. 129
<br><br>Now we thing I want to introduce you to is something called constant. 130
<br><br>Let's see if I've got a slide. 131
<br><br>Here you go. 132
<br><br>When a value doesnt change at run-time, when the game is playing, 133
<br><br>when the code is executing, it's called a constant. 134
<br><br>It's a bit faster to run, but more importantly it's clearer to read. 135
<br><br>And the way we make something a constant is we just put the word const 136
<br><br>in front of the definition. 137
<br><br>So this string that we've defined here, 138
<br><br>this menu here is a very classic example of where we could make that constant. 139
<br><br>This is never gonna change. 140
<br><br>You can't do it with these arrays because we could change the arrays later. 141
<br><br>And it just won't let us do it. 142
<br><br>There's a possibility we could change them later. 143
<br><br>But if we say const string menuHint like that, we cannot change menuHint later. 144
<br><br>Let's have a go. 145
<br><br>Let's try saying here in Start menuHint = "something else". 146
<br><br>And what does it say? 147
<br><br>The left-hand side of an assignment, we're assigning this to this. 148
<br><br>Must be a variable property or index. 149
<br><br>Well, it's not a variable anymore, it's a constant, okay? 150
<br><br>And that is, okay, [INAUDIBLE] more efficient runs faster again at this stage. 151
<br><br>But it's much clearer to read. 152
<br><br>We're saying that we are making the decision now, and 153
<br><br>we're just shrink wrapping this and it's not going to change. 154
<br><br>Unfortunately, we can't easily say constant. 155
<br><br>For our string array because we're gonna get an error that says 156
<br><br>it must be constant. 157
<br><br>So arrays don't work quite the same way with const but certainly with simple types 158
<br><br>like strings and integers, you can use this const keyword. 159
<br><br>And it's a pretty good idea to do that. 160
<br><br>Wow, what progress we've made now,. I've got a great challenge for you, 161
<br><br>which is going to be to add a third difficulty level to the game. 162
<br><br>It sounds simple but it's gonna be a great exercise. 163
<br><br>Just adding a third difficulty, a new set of words, new level reward, 164
<br><br>anything you feel like doing. 165
<br><br>Make it all coherent and tight, share your level 3 reward 166
<br><br>art in the community with us and I'll look forward to seeing for my solution. 167
<br><br>All right, guys, so the way I am going to do this is I am going to accept that I am 168
<br><br>doing something very similar for the third time. 169
<br><br>In future sections, we will learn about more advanced coding tools that 170
<br><br>would allow us to do this type of thing even more efficiently with less repeating. 171
<br><br>But for now I'm just gonna get in here and do this. 172
<br><br>Now I think the words we decided were starfield. 173
<br><br>Telescope, Environment, 174
<br><br>And they're all themed together, and they're longer, this is part of the point, 175
<br><br>exploration. 176
<br><br>And astronauts. 177
<br><br>Now what you need to do with these to find out if you've got a difficulty spike, 178
<br><br>is to test these things with some friends or family, and see what they think. 179
<br><br>See if they think that this is a reasonable difficulty for each level. 180
<br><br>All right, I'm gonna come in and press level 3 for NASA Exclamation mark. 181
<br><br>That reminds me, in the level two reward,. I think I want to say to people, 182
<br><br>one other thing after they get the key, which is play again for 183
<br><br>an even greater challenge or something like that. 184
<br><br>Just to say to them hey, there's something else out there. 185
<br><br>So if I put that here, we can say play again for a greater challenge. 186
<br><br>Always try to encourage your player to carry on, so I'm gonna do that. 187
<br><br>All right, back up to the top of the file. 188
<br><br>I have my press 3 for NASA. 189
<br><br>What else do I need to do? 190
<br><br>Is valid level number, we gonna need to just do another OR on there, we can do OR 191
<br><br>more than once, so well done if you got this one. 192
<br><br>By the way, this is something that would be very new to you, so 193
<br><br>this may have tripped you up and it's fine if it did. 194
<br><br>And it's interesting to find out for 195
<br><br>yourself what things come naturally to you and what things aren't so natural. 196
<br><br>So once we've put that valid level in it, 197
<br><br>it will be automatically converted, we should be good from there. 198
<br><br>Then we need a new case in our set random password, again of course, 199
<br><br>there are coding structures that would mean less repetition but 200
<br><br>we are not gonna deal with them in this section. 201
<br><br>So level three passwords, and most of the time, it's just copying and pasting and 202
<br><br>changing two for three. 203
<br><br>So the final thing we need to do is take a new case for 204
<br><br>NASA down here, and then decide what we're going to say in the case of NASA. 205
<br><br>So, what did we decide in our design? 206
<br><br>I think I've got it written down here. 207
<br><br>I think we said actually, no text initially, and 208
<br><br>then we were just gonna do a NASA piece of. ASCII art, which I'll do in just a second. 209
<br><br>And then we were gonna go Welcome to NASA's 210
<br><br>internal system! 211
<br><br>All right, so the final thing remains is for me to do the ASCII art here. 212
<br><br>I'll just write the word NASA and prove that he game works and then I'll leave you 213
<br><br>with a sped up video of me doing the ASCII art rather than laboring the point. 214
<br><br>So case 3, that's all good. 215
<br><br>So my cases are all good, that's something that will catch you out, 216
<br><br>the level3Passwords in here needs to be the case. 217
<br><br>You need to add the password to your isValidLevelNumber boolean, yeah, 218
<br><br>make sure it's everywhere. 219
<br><br>So the only thing that won't work is it's just gonna very boringly say no, so 220
<br><br>let's just say I'll turn that into. ASCII art speed in a bit, and 221
<br><br>we just check that the game flow works. 222
<br><br>3 for NASA! 223
<br><br>Great. 224
<br><br>Ooh, that password hint is uniform, which does not sound like a NASA one. 225
<br><br>So let's go and see what's going wrong there. 226
<br><br>If I look at my code,. I have chosen level3. 227
<br><br>See, look what I've done here. 228
<br><br>This needs to be in two places, which is exactly why we would, 229
<br><br>as we move forward with our coding skills want to avoid this type of [INAUDIBLE]. 230
<br><br>I put level3 here, I didn't put it here, so it used the length for 231
<br><br>the level3 passwords but it looked inside the level2 array, all right. 232
<br><br>So that's the sort of thing that might catch you out. 233
<br><br>So with a [INAUDIBLE] tested, 234
<br><br>the most likely problems are gonna be when you choose level3. 235
<br><br>That's more like it. 236
<br><br>Environment, Welcome to. NASA's internal system. 237
<br><br>Awesome, that worked. 238
<br><br>Let's just check that level two, holster, oops. 239
<br><br>You may I type menu anytime, didn't get that right, handcuffs. 240
<br><br>That's better, play again for a greater challenge. 241
<br><br>Also now I like how that's feeling. 242
<br><br>So what I'm gonna do is. I to finish my game off, 243
<br><br>I'm just gonna go in fast time start doing NASA in ASCII art. 244
<br><br>So the general idea with this ASCII art is to build it up line by line. 245
<br><br>It's very much an art form, so you're just gonna have to experiment with it. 246
<br><br>Of course,. I'm doing this at five times speed and 247
<br><br>I'm recording over the top of this. 248
<br><br>Nearly every video I make, 249
<br><br>I record in real time in one take or sometimes several take. 250
<br><br>But in this case obviously, you don't wanna watch me do this in real time, 251
<br><br>it really bore you. 252
<br><br>But the general principles of this are looking to use brackets and 253
<br><br>apostrophes and wherever I can get my hands on really to try and 254
<br><br>make this thing look something like the word NASA. 255
<br><br>And I'm just building it up line by line, in this case, 256
<br><br>I'm copying it from a piece of paper. 257
<br><br>But expect to [INAUDIBLE] even longer than this, so this is sped up five times. 258
<br><br>All right, so that's done. 259
<br><br>Let's just see how it feels. 260
<br><br>Number three for NASA. 261
<br><br>Just come in here and see if we can get it right. 262
<br><br>Astaunauts, there you go, we got a typo. 263
<br><br>Let's just go fix that typo, that's gonna happen. 264
<br><br>So as, A-S-T-R, for somebody who use to be. European Space Agency astronaut candidate, 265
<br><br>not very good that I can't spell astronaut. 266
<br><br>But that is the [INAUDIBLE], let's go ahead and get to level three, 267
<br><br>boom, and in Environment NASA,. I think that looks quite good. 268
<br><br>Took me a while to make yours will take a while to make too but that's good. 269
<br><br>Well done, awesome. 270
<br><br>I'm nearly there.
