Hey would you like to learn to code by making computer games.
1

My name is Ben and I've already taught over three hundred thousand people like you to learn to code by making games.
2

And I've teamed up with... Hey, I'm Rick I've been a game designer for more than 13 years.
3

and we're super excited to bring you this complete unity developer course.
4

So even if you've never touched C# or coding before this course is for you.
5

We start off with a game called Terminal Hacker, a simple hacking game where you learn the fundamentals
6

of C#.
7

Moving on from there what do we do Rick?
8

We jump into Project Boost which is a game that's going to teach you all that unity and how unity works
9

moving things onscreen, rotating, collisions, particle effects, lighting, lots of great fundamentals
10

with Unity and a really versatile game where you can take it any direction you want create something
11

that's shippable.
Absolutely.
12

And in section 3 we fuse those together in Argon Assault.
13

This is a Rails Shooter, your hurtling into the screen through a three dimensional terrain, moving your
14

ship around using keyboard or gamepad, particle effects, collisions, user interface for score, all sorts.
15

Following on from that,
16

we jump into a 3D Tower Defence game where we are placing towers and spawning enemies.
17

And there's a real heavy emphasis in this section on teaching you the fundamentals of pathfinding and
18

building your own pathfinding algorithm.
19

Absolutely. So remember, with Udemy you get lifetime access.
20

It's a great time to learn to code, and no more fun way than by making games,
21

So please, join this course now.
