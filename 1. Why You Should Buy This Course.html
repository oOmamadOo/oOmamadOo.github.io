Hey would you like to learn to code by making computer games. 1
<br><br>My name is Ben and I've already taught over three hundred thousand people like you to learn to code by making games. 2
<br><br>And I've teamed up with... Hey, I'm Rick I've been a game designer for more than 13 years. 3
<br><br>and we're super excited to bring you this complete unity developer course. 4
<br><br>So even if you've never touched C# or coding before this course is for you. 5
<br><br>We start off with a game called Terminal Hacker, a simple hacking game where you learn the fundamentals 6
<br><br>of C#. 7
<br><br>Moving on from there what do we do Rick? 8
<br><br>We jump into Project Boost which is a game that's going to teach you all that unity and how unity works 9
<br><br>moving things onscreen, rotating, collisions, particle effects, lighting, lots of great fundamentals 10
<br><br>with Unity and a really versatile game where you can take it any direction you want create something 11
<br><br>that's shippable.. Absolutely. 12
<br><br>And in section 3 we fuse those together in Argon Assault. 13
<br><br>This is a Rails Shooter, your hurtling into the screen through a three dimensional terrain, moving your 14
<br><br>ship around using keyboard or gamepad, particle effects, collisions, user interface for score, all sorts. 15
<br><br>Following on from that, 16
<br><br>we jump into a 3D Tower Defence game where we are placing towers and spawning enemies. 17
<br><br>And there's a real heavy emphasis in this section on teaching you the fundamentals of pathfinding and 18
<br><br>building your own pathfinding algorithm. 19
<br><br>Absolutely. So remember, with Udemy you get lifetime access. 20
<br><br>It's a great time to learn to code, and no more fun way than by making games, 21
<br><br>So please, join this course now.
