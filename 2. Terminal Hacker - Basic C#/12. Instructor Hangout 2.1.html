Hey guys welcome to another instructor hang out we're going to answer some questions you've been asking
<br><br>in the Q and A section and the forum.
<br><br>Going to grobin with some.
<br><br>But how does it work.
<br><br>Type questions and we cover some other things so how do you then how's it going.
<br><br>Very well thank you.
<br><br>Now I have been bought a lovely massive mug of pumpkin soup steaming from my wife and I need to drink
<br><br>it as we go.
<br><br>I'm working all hours in this office so excuse me if I Nutri 8 myself.
<br><br>I think that's a word it's not a word trick used with a word.
<br><br>OK so the First though we've got we've been working through terminal hacker and we've provided a lot
<br><br>of magic black box and we don't use the word magic encoding but a lot of like what's going on.
<br><br>How will they.
<br><br>We've been asking but how does that work.
<br><br>How do I know what's going on when someone types in some employ it what's actually happening in there.
<br><br>What should we what shall we know about that at this stage.
<br><br>OK.
<br><br>So let me share my screen so we can take a little butcher's hook or look as we call it over here.
<br><br>And what we want to do is understand that the purpose of this section is purely to teach you fundamental
<br><br>see shot.
<br><br>And we've hidden away all the details of how our terminal works and we we don't want you asking the
<br><br>question of how the terminal works because it's pretty scary the answer.
<br><br>But let me just show you a couple of things.
<br><br>We have provided you with some functions called on user input and various others that you'll use later
<br><br>like terminal Doc clear screen and terminal.
<br><br>Right line.
<br><br>So those things basically work by some magic that we've hidden away in this w.m. two thousand fold it
<br><br>in some C sharp files.
<br><br>It's something that we wrote for you so that you can just access unity access our console and just treat
<br><br>it like an appliance if you like like a toaster.
<br><br>So.
<br><br>You learn about this later.
<br><br>But what I do want to say is that you're starting to get the idea that start happens at the games start.
<br><br>Show me in many ways something you've defined yourself.
<br><br>User input happens when the user hits the return key and we have organised for on user input to be activated
<br><br>called whatever you want to call it at this early stage in the course when the user hits the return
<br><br>key over in that terminal in the same way that start happens at the beginning of the game.
<br><br>I just want to leave it at that for the moment because it's quite involved how it's actually working
<br><br>it's using something called Unity's a search see schutz reflection system well beyond what we need to
<br><br>know for the moment basically works by magic just for now.
<br><br>Awesome awesome.
<br><br>Great explanation.
<br><br>Thank you for the similar kind of thing.
<br><br>A slight zigzag is people asking about that void.
<br><br>I know we've explained void a little bit throughout this section and what it means but my initial reaction
<br><br>when I saw the word void was like on a blank check.
<br><br>Right.
<br><br>Right.
<br><br>Void.
<br><br>Yes.
<br><br>Don't process invalidate it or something.
<br><br>Yeah.
<br><br>What's what's a good neat way for us to summarize void if someone struggling with that concept.
<br><br>Okay so it turns out in the learning journey about our coding that to get to void which is a something
<br><br>called a return type from a function is quite a few steps to get there.
<br><br>And you don't even do it in Project boost.
<br><br>We don't even deal with that in any in any detail.
<br><br>So it's going to be saying the next section that we're going to do in-house project looping the next
<br><br>section are called rocket flying section.
<br><br>So it's going to be a couple of sections before you really get a proper sense for what void does because
<br><br>you won't really know what it's doing until you use it.
<br><br>So I'm very much about let's revisit things repeatedly it's a spiral syllabus.
<br><br>But having said that let me just give you a brief overview of what's going on here.
<br><br>So for the first couple of sections this section and project boost all of our functions are going to
<br><br>be void functions and what it means is that nothing comes back.
<br><br>So in Start when we call show main menu we're telling the computer to go off and execute code inside
<br><br>show me menu.
<br><br>But we're not expecting a reply from that is just an instruction.
<br><br>Go and show the main menu.
<br><br>Nothing's coming back.
<br><br>We can't.
<br><br>It doesn't report back to us with a status or a number or anything.
<br><br>So that's what void means it means when you define your show main menu function you're saying nothing
<br><br>is supposed to be coming back.
<br><br>We're not returning anything.
<br><br>Nothing goes back to the caller the caller being the start menu.
<br><br>Nothing's coming back out.
<br><br>So hopefully that's just an introduction to why why everything is void again.
<br><br>For now it's just magic or some brain or thinking for that and the other big topic that I see floating
<br><br>around at the moment is some people have had some conflicts in terms of the version of unity or a visual
<br><br>studio that they're using.
<br><br>And our recommendation is normally try to use the version that we're using now.
<br><br>But as the Course goes on we're going to keep coming back and updating and improving and working on
<br><br>staff and unit he's going to launch more versions.
<br><br>Who knows they might be releasing them on a weekly basis 2017.
<br><br>Point two point three and point four and 2019 and 2020.
<br><br>So what what would you recommend if someone is watching this right now we're using 2017 point one and
<br><br>someone has a different version of unity available to them.
<br><br>What do we recommend.
<br><br>OK.
<br><br>So if you're in something older than 2017 I recommend you upgrade to 2017 if you're on 2018 2019 if
<br><br>you're still taking this course at that point the Course will still be valid the fundamentals that we're
<br><br>teaching we'll will be very much value and we are not going to go through and update the whole course.
<br><br>Every time you do we update because the fundamentals you're learning aren't changing.
<br><br>So the advice is probably pretty simple you take the course in the version you've got.
<br><br>Twenty seventeen point two or later could be 2018 2019 2020 hope and wishful thinking.
<br><br>But if you're having problems it's very easy to solve them.
<br><br>This is the way you solve.
<br><br>What you do is you do unity.
<br><br>But that was get confused.
<br><br>But usually you'd have me before am I here and I if you me up there.
<br><br>So it is unity.
<br><br>Yes.
<br><br>So if we go unity download archive then unity are particularly good at giving you access to all their
<br><br>previous versions.
<br><br>Here you go you can go back to unity five four three at the time of writing back into 2012.
<br><br>So I'm pretty confident they will carry on with this.
<br><br>And you can always go back to 2017 and pick the version we were using or one very close to it that would
<br><br>be the best way to make sure that the experience are having matches what you see on our screen.
<br><br>But you'll often find things are back compatible and it's not a problem.
<br><br>Yeah.
<br><br>Cool.
<br><br>Excellent.
<br><br>I want to know a shout out here on who is sharing their their words and their lives.
<br><br>There's been some very creative things a lot of things that maybe aren't you know that you don't want
<br><br>the government to see that you're actually riding that into a computer program.
<br><br>Lots of really neat things that you guys are creating and sharing and coming up with this project isn't
<br><br>so much of a follow on game days but a lot of the way we're creating this course is that you get the
<br><br>fundamentals of this now and in the next section you get some more in this section he gets more and
<br><br>so on and at each point you can come back and then expand what it is you're doing now.
<br><br>So if the win or hack game really appeals to you there's a lot more you're going to learn later on in.
<br><br>Come back and apply to it.
<br><br>Make it a fuller experience.
<br><br>Yeah I'd just like to take a second Actually if I can to to talk about and then use the word spiral
<br><br>syllabus quite a lot but I think it's probably worth me just drawing what.
<br><br>What on earth do I mean by a spiral syllabus.
<br><br>So very briefly.
<br><br>Quite a lot of mess on my screen right now but if we focus on the middle here the zoom whiteboard.
<br><br>The concept is.
<br><br>If we take a particular topic let's say functions then functions are a slice of a circular based cone
<br><br>in my model here so is a circular based cone and there this kind of slice up here there may be you know
<br><br>these are functions here and there's a lot to learn about function so the way that we're going to teacher
<br><br>is were going to visit functions in a very cursory way.
<br><br>We're going to go around the pyramid mean visiting the variety of other topics from C sharp topics to
<br><br>Unity topics to game design topics and we'll get back to functions again and then we'll go round and
<br><br>we'll talk about particle systems and other C sharp stuff and and and arrays and lists and variables
<br><br>and blah blah and then we'll come back to functions again.
<br><br>So you won't really have a good understanding of a deep understanding of functions until we've been
<br><br>round the loop lots of time so don't make the following mistake.
<br><br>Don't like C functions that oh I can't carry on because I don't know samwell voices you really can carry
<br><br>on.
<br><br>You use lights which is that knowing exactly how the electricity works.
<br><br>Please let yourself Carry On have faith that we've got your back.
<br><br>We've got the learning journey we will revisit revisit revisit this spiral syllabus lets you build on
<br><br>what you've actually built an experience on.
<br><br>It lets your diffused motor thinking get hold of the stuff you learn early.
<br><br>Kind of really embed it and then when you come back to it you're much clearer and you got much more
<br><br>context so let us take you on a spiral learning journey.
<br><br>Don't get stuck keep moving forward.
<br><br>By the way thank you too.
<br><br>J.
<br><br>F..
<br><br>His is the handle on the forum or the handle on unity for bringing up the question about what void does.
<br><br>Thanks Jay.
<br><br>Wonderful.
<br><br>Great stuff.
<br><br>Well as always you guys you doing great work.
<br><br>Keep practicing keep pushing along.
<br><br>Keep giving feedback keep showing your work keep sharing what you're up to.
<br><br>We love to hear from you guys.
<br><br>We love your questions and thank you to everyone who's doing such a great job of helping out in the
<br><br>community on the forum in the Q and A section answering questions.
<br><br>It's massive that you guys are helping out and really supporting the community that way.
<br><br>Yeah.
<br><br>That's absolutely huge.
<br><br>And talking about the forum the forum is an optional extra right so everything you need to do is over
<br><br>here on udemy if we act as a student for a moment.
<br><br>You've got your video and then alongside your video you've got the Q and A section as you used to.
<br><br>You don't have to leave you do me.
<br><br>But if you want to use your time in go outside of a cube like then you have over here our forum and
<br><br>the way this is structured is unity two is the overarching area that you're going to want and then you
<br><br>can drill in by the section in this case in terminal.
<br><br>And then every single lecture has got its own little taggy thing.
<br><br>Now the easy way to get to the posts that are relevant to the lecturer on is every lecture has a link
<br><br>against it in the resources called Project what's it called something like lecture discussions forum
<br><br>or something.
<br><br>It's not the same linkon every lecture every lecture we've painstakingly linked to a different tag in
<br><br>the form in it to bring you somewhere like this.
<br><br>And what this is showing you these are all the topics that people have raised against this particular
<br><br>electorate.
<br><br>Share online and playtest for example.
<br><br>So get in there see what other people are doing.
<br><br>You know another tip on our forum is hit Shift and question mark and it'll bring up the keyboard shortcuts
<br><br>you can navigate.
<br><br>Man this thing at lightning speed and that's going to be really helpful so do make use of our optional
<br><br>free forum.
<br><br>It's people absolutely love it particularly when you're sharing stuff visuals screenshots videos all
<br><br>that type of stuff that a B or C.
<br><br>Excellent.
<br><br>Wonderful.
<br><br>So thanks for hanging out with us for another instructor hang out and we'll see you guys in the next
<br><br>lectures.
<br><br>See you guys.
