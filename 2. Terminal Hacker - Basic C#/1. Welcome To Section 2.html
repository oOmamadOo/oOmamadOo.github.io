Welcome to section two, where we are going to build terminal hacker. 2
<br><br>We're gonna provide you an off the shelf package that gets you as far as 3
<br><br>a blank terminal screen with a flashing cursor and 4
<br><br>some background sound of some key stroke noises. 5
<br><br>And you are gonna write the code as if you are programming an old school terminal. 6
<br><br>And the purpose of this section is to teach you all of the basic foundation of 7
<br><br>C-sharp skills you're gonna need moving forward. 8
<br><br>If you're already an experience. C-sharp developer, 9
<br><br>you're not gonna learn much about. C-sharp from this section, you are gonna 10
<br><br>learn our code style and you're gonna learn roughly how we do things. 11
<br><br>I suggest you just go through the section really quickly to make sure that 12
<br><br>we're on the same page. 13
<br><br>But if you're completely new to coding, this is gonna be a fantastic foundational 14
<br><br>section for you, building on what we've learned in the previous section. 15
<br><br>And you're not gonna learn any Unity-specific stuff 16
<br><br>in this section on purpose. 17
<br><br>It is designed as a C-sharp primer, because frankly, 18
<br><br>this is the hardest bit of getting started with Unity, is getting into the coding. 19
<br><br>So it's gonna be a great coding exercise and I look forward to seeing you in there. 20
<br><br>And I'll see you again at the end of the section.
