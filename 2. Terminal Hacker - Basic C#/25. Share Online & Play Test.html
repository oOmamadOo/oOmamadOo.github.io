[MUSIC] 2
<br><br>In the last video, why did I say we were almost there, 3
<br><br>when the game is pretty much done, in fact? 4
<br><br>It's, I would say, feature complete. 5
<br><br>Well, something's seriously missing. 6
<br><br>We've not tried this on a player. 7
<br><br>And we haven't even got a facility to sensibly share it with anybody, 8
<br><br>so let's show you how to do that. 9
<br><br>The way that we're gonna build and run this is as follows, by the way, 10
<br><br>you're gonna have a challenge to do this, so you can watch me do it or 11
<br><br>you can follow me along, if you follow me along now you'll have done the challenge, 12
<br><br>if you watch me do it then you'll get the opportunity to remember. 13
<br><br>So to make this work we have to be firstly, in the scene. 14
<br><br>Okay, so, we're in the game scene like this which is fine we have been 15
<br><br>most of the time. 16
<br><br>You go to file and then build settings, is the first thing. 17
<br><br>And then you enter add open scenes and then in the scenes and 18
<br><br>build list we'll have the game scene or 19
<br><br>whatever you called it, it'll have game scene index zero again counting from zero. 20
<br><br>We only have one scene in this game, we choose on the platform WebGL. 21
<br><br>If for some reason you don't have that re-run the Unity installer and 22
<br><br>make sure you select that as an add-on, okay? 23
<br><br>Now what we're gonna do is simply build and run, 24
<br><br>now you can choose to put that wherever you like. 25
<br><br>I'm gonna put it in my downloads on the computer, so I'm just gonna click save and 26
<br><br>now we're gonna have to wait awhile. 27
<br><br>Now I had to replace because. I've already built to there. 28
<br><br>And it's gonna be a lot quicker because I've already built to there. 29
<br><br>But this could take anywhere from maybe a minute, 30
<br><br>if you got a pretty fast machine to it could be several minutes. 31
<br><br>Now if you do have any trouble with this, then I have provided you with a link to 32
<br><br>building and running a WebGL project over 33
<br><br>on the Unity manualet, in the resources, all right, so this will allow your game 34
<br><br>to run in a web browser on a desktop, it won't run properly on a mobile. 35
<br><br>It will load up on a recent iPhone or. Android phone, but it won't actually work 36
<br><br>properly and that's explained by the game when you try and run it on a mobile. 37
<br><br>It's just a limitation of. Unity's WebGL builds at the moment. 38
<br><br>What is WebGL? 39
<br><br>It's a way of running open GL style games or 40
<br><br>just web graphics library games on the web. 41
<br><br>So, we need to be patient, you'll notice that while it's building on your 42
<br><br>Unity icon you may have a little progress bar, otherwise, 43
<br><br>you're just gonna kind of sit and wait until that finishes. 44
<br><br>It will take, as I say, a little while to go. 45
<br><br>There are some things you can play with like player settings, etc, but for 46
<br><br>the first build of this I wouldn't bother. 47
<br><br>So while it's building, let me show you something else. 48
<br><br>We've built you a free service. 49
<br><br>There's two ways that you can share your game that I can think of, actually, 50
<br><br>there's loads, but one easy way would be to use sharemygame.com we built this for 51
<br><br>you, it's really simple we are at step one which is make a WebGL build. 52
<br><br>When that's done, I'll show you how to simply zip the folder up, 53
<br><br>which is fairly trivial and then we'll upgrade it and you can learn, upload it, 54
<br><br>rather and you can play it from here. 55
<br><br>The other much more comprehensive option if you want to start building yourself 56
<br><br>a portfolio is to go to H.IO. 57
<br><br>We're not going to tell you exactly how to use H.IO, but 58
<br><br>this will give you a lot more features and options, but it's a lot harder to use. 59
<br><br>All right, so for the sake of this course we're gonna use sharemygame.com. 60
<br><br>So when it's finished building it'll pop up in a local host browser like this and 61
<br><br>you should be able to click, maybe, you need to click on the terminal screen, one, 62
<br><br>two, three, whatever and the game will run. 63
<br><br>All right, so let's go find it on our file system. 64
<br><br>So on the file system, it looks something like this and you may not actually be 65
<br><br>able to successfully run it by double clicking index.html, 66
<br><br>don't be spooked by that, if it ran when it first popped up automatically on Unity, 67
<br><br>then it was running a little local web server on your machine and all is fine. 68
<br><br>What we need to do is simply, this hacker folder that is created, 69
<br><br>we simply compress it or right click and say compress hacker or 70
<br><br>send it to compressed folder on. Windows and you get hacker.zip. 71
<br><br>All right, so you build to the folder, zip it just like it says on Share My Game and 72
<br><br>then number three, upload your game, so you go and point it to the hacker.zip. 73
<br><br>Should be five, ten megs, something like that. 74
<br><br>It'll upload Our service will unpack that zip, process it, host the file for 75
<br><br>you, you'll get free hosting for 30 days and your game is a maximum of 100 meg. 76
<br><br>Now the only way to keep a link to this game is to keep hold of the URL, 77
<br><br>so don't lose the URL. 78
<br><br>That's going to appear in a minute on. Share My Game, just don't push anything 79
<br><br>while it processes, while this what I like to call a whirly gig or a process wheel or 80
<br><br>whatever you wanna call it, spinner, is going. 81
<br><br>When that finishes, you'll get a URL that you can then go and 82
<br><br>share on social media so you could, for example, go to FB group Unity. 83
<br><br>Let me just show you the URL for that facebook.com/groups/completeunitydeveloper 84
<br><br>here and there is a public group which you are very welcome to join and 85
<br><br>become one of the happy faces or you go to our community website and share there. 86
<br><br>The best way to get to the community website, though, 87
<br><br>is to use the link in resources and go straight to this lecture. 88
<br><br>Okay, so look, there it is on. Share My Game, you have a public URL. 89
<br><br>That means you can share this game with anybody anywhere on the planet. 90
<br><br>That is not to be underestimated, so, awesome news. 91
<br><br>Remember you have to click into the window and then you can start playing, all right? 92
<br><br>And you can scroll down to get it more central. 93
<br><br>So grab this URL, go share it, share it on Twitter, share it on Facebook, 94
<br><br>share it on our Facebook group, on the community site, 95
<br><br>come over to Discord, our Discord server,. I'll pop a invite for 96
<br><br>the Discord server in the resources of this lecture for you, as well. 97
<br><br>Share it everywhere, get some feedback and what I want you to do is a bit of 98
<br><br>a challenge,. I want you to do some playtesting. 99
<br><br>Now, quickly gonna talk you through play-testing, play-testing 101, this is. 100
<br><br>So very briefly, the idea of play-testing is to get some feedback from 101
<br><br>an uninitiated user, watch them try and play the game. 102
<br><br>Resist the temptation to train or correct them as they do it, 103
<br><br>take notes on what they do, only help them if they get stuck. 104
<br><br>Give them positive encouragement as they go through and when they've 105
<br><br>had enough and you feel like the learning curve is stabilized, maybe, after a few 106
<br><br>minutes with this game, then sit down and have a good two way discussion about it. 107
<br><br>Try and watch this, ideally, screen record at least take some notes, try and 108
<br><br>watch what they're doing and go ahead and do that. 109
<br><br>So I want you to share your game with us. 110
<br><br>By the end of the challenge your game should be uploaded to sharemygame.com our 111
<br><br>free service or HEO or something similar, it should play on desktop browsers. 112
<br><br>Remember to click on the terminal before you start typing, 113
<br><br>it won't work on mobile properly. 114
<br><br>Somebody else, anybody, anywhere in the world should have tried it and 115
<br><br>the quickest way for you to get this feedback is for 116
<br><br>you to go to our Discord server in the hash Unity channel, 117
<br><br>link in the resources and you can get instant feedback. 118
<br><br>An ideal and that's not ideal is it,. I'll fix the slide live, 119
<br><br>ideally, I'd like you to watch in person or screen share and take notes as you go. 120
<br><br>All right, pause the video, go and do your screen sharing now and your play- testing. 121
<br><br>All right, welcome back, so, now we're gonna go into a session with my wife, 122
<br><br>Lizzie and I'm gonna show you how we did our play-test and 123
<br><br>what we learned from that play-test. 124
<br><br>So here I am with my ridiculously beautiful wife, 125
<br><br>she's doing the play-testing. 126
<br><br>And the first thing we noticed, of course, is that you have to actually 127
<br><br>click on the web browser window to get things working, so, Lizzie, 128
<br><br>start playing the game, let's see what we learn, be really interesting to see. 129
<br><br>So there's no substitute, for somebody, an actual user who hasn't 130
<br><br>got a lot of experience in the game playing it, so let's see what happens. 131
<br><br>She's a ninja, by the way, at anagrams, so 132
<br><br>you're going to have to excuse how quickly she solves these things. 133
<br><br>She doesn't actually know what all the words are. 134
<br><br>She can just see anagrams kind of automatically. 135
<br><br>I don't know quite how she does it, but here she goes, she's doing it. 136
<br><br>Now, something that happened on this screen last time, show them Lizzy, 137
<br><br>she typed actually play here and then tried typing again. 138
<br><br>So that's quite interesting, it's because the words are where 139
<br><br>we expect the instructions to be or something like that, but anyway just note, 140
<br><br>that the words down there confuse people, so finally we go to menu. 141
<br><br>That's not the users fault, its our fault as designers. 142
<br><br>We haven't anticipated that so we should probably tweak the instructions there, 143
<br><br>be consistent is the word. 144
<br><br>I think Lizzy wants to say something, what do you want to say honey? 145
<br><br>Or you could put in an Easter egg there, instead. 146
<br><br>&gt;&gt; And that was, very tacitly or 147
<br><br>you can put an Easter egg there instead, that's a good idea. 148
<br><br>Now that word that's on the screen now,. I haven't got a snowball's chance in a hot 149
<br><br>place of working out, but I still suspect that Lizzie will work it out. 150
<br><br>I can remember what it is, actually. 151
<br><br>She's pulling a fantastic face here as she tries to work out what the word is. 152
<br><br>This is like Countdown, that tv show. 153
<br><br>So, here it comes, the countdown, see if we can get it. 154
<br><br>&gt;&gt; Ditto. &gt;&gt; Ditto. Dit, do, do, do. No, hold on. 155
<br><br>Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do,do, do, ditto, do, do, ditto, do, do. 156
<br><br>[SOUND]. So after staring at it for 157
<br><br>a while, Lizzie's typed menu, going back to the beginning and chosen NASA again and 158
<br><br>finally she has succeeded at the highest level of hacking prowess. 159
<br><br>So, a very short game but a lot of fun,. I think, thank you, awesome and of course 160
<br><br>doesn't know how to respond to that, menu does work great, so it seems to work. 161
<br><br>And there's no way of getting out the game. 162
<br><br>Lizzie just try and leave this game see how you would close this down if you're 163
<br><br>playing this on a browser, what would you try and do? 164
<br><br>You try exit, you try close, if that doesn't work, 165
<br><br>how would just kind of close the whole game? 166
<br><br>Okay and if none of that works, how else would you close it? 167
<br><br>See this actually suggests we, 168
<br><br>maybe, wanna put a condition in here where a quit exit or something else, 169
<br><br>quit close exit, one of those might want to actually end execution of the game. 170
<br><br>Of course, what we can't do is just close the browser, but 171
<br><br>the user could get stuck in a local loop not thinking about the wider picture, 172
<br><br>which is that you could just close the browser. 173
<br><br>Okay, fantastic, that is the play-test over, we will now implement 174
<br><br>what we've learned from the results of that play-test and we will go from there.
