In this video we're gonna be discussing design levers and talking about some ideas 2
<br><br>for what you guys could do in order to make your game different to our game. 3
<br><br>Just a quick reminder at the start of this video, 4
<br><br>make sure you prefab everything in your scene, 5
<br><br>so I'm just gonna drop the backdrop in there and make it's prefab nicely. 6
<br><br>And what I wanna talk to you about is the design levers that you have at 7
<br><br>your disposal. 8
<br><br>There's so much that you can do in your game that doesn't require creating 9
<br><br>an extra feature or implementing new aspects of code, and 10
<br><br>taking a whole lot of time to do that. 11
<br><br>And I know a lot of what we're doing is learning how to code, which is excellent. 12
<br><br>But we're also learning how to make games. 13
<br><br>I know a lot of you wanna make this game or make a game, any game, 14
<br><br>this particular game, and ship it, and have people play, have people interested. 15
<br><br>So let's talk a little bit about that, not too, too much, 16
<br><br>cuz I know we've got our primary goals here oflearning C# and Unity, but 17
<br><br>a little about learning how to be a game developer, a game designer as well. 18
<br><br>So as indie developers, it's really, 19
<br><br>really important that you try to use what you have already to make new, or 20
<br><br>different, or better gameplay before you go and add new features. 21
<br><br>And so if we look at what our current design levers are, 22
<br><br>what I mean by design lever is something that we can tweak or tune, or 23
<br><br>change to make our game feel significantly different. 24
<br><br>So let's jump into our build and have a look at that at the moment. 25
<br><br>So if I fly around, this is a great say yourself, what can I do? 26
<br><br>Let's just have a look by flying around. 27
<br><br>So first of all, there is the thrust. 28
<br><br>The speed of the thrust is something we can choose. 29
<br><br>That's a design lever literally where we can put the main thrust up and 30
<br><br>our rocket will go much faster. 31
<br><br>Then if we have it all the way down. 32
<br><br>What happens if we go negative, actually, that's interesting. 33
<br><br>Nothing, okay. 34
<br><br>Fine, sometimes let's play around this things just to see if we can come out 35
<br><br>with, actually I hadn't clicked back in my scene, let me try this one more time. 36
<br><br>It just, it doesn't go any way, obviously. 37
<br><br>If we turn upside down, I'm gonna push this tool a little bit more. 38
<br><br>Okay, we go backwards. 39
<br><br>That could be something cool. 40
<br><br>A backwards flying rocket. 41
<br><br>So this is the example. 42
<br><br>What I wanna show you in this video is the fact that when you play around with these 43
<br><br>things and look at your design levers, you can come up with totally different games. 44
<br><br>My rocket's gone fling off that way. 45
<br><br>By putting the thrust to negative, we've come up with the idea of, 46
<br><br>what if the rocket is going backwards? 47
<br><br>What if you're controlling not a rocket but 48
<br><br>some sort of jet pack, but the jet pack guy is out of control. 49
<br><br>So this is how you come up with new design ideas, is to get in there and 50
<br><br>play around with these things. 51
<br><br>So I was just starting. 52
<br><br>That was the first one. 53
<br><br>We've got a couple ideas. 54
<br><br>We can have it super, super, super fast. 55
<br><br>Then it becomes this game of, 56
<br><br>how on Earth am I gonna control my ship when it's so fast? 57
<br><br>We can have it super slow, we can have it negative. 58
<br><br>We can do things like changing the rotation, as another design lever. 59
<br><br>What else have we got here? 60
<br><br>Obviously, the way that we lay out our level. 61
<br><br>So there's lots of design levers here. 62
<br><br>Just by placing obstacles,. I can put another ten obstacles in here. 63
<br><br>I can have this gap between these really tiny, so 64
<br><br>it's a design lever of difficulty, that I can play around with. 65
<br><br>I can have these pad that I need to land on really tiny or 66
<br><br>really huge, I could have, what else do we have? 67
<br><br>I can change my lighting,. I can change my camera. 68
<br><br>So there's just a few things that we can start to look at to make our game feel 69
<br><br>different to what it is already. 70
<br><br>And so here's a list of things just rotation, thrust, 71
<br><br>gravity, the size of the plane, that's a good one as well. 72
<br><br>If we go in here and just scale this up, probably not that much scaling up a bunch, 73
<br><br>that's gonna make this game feel different. 74
<br><br>Obviously, we could have just gone and change all of our level elements as well, 75
<br><br>made the level a different size, but 76
<br><br>it's [LAUGH] this is kind of weird and fun in a way. 77
<br><br>And so that's up to us to figure out. 78
<br><br>If we play around with these things, it might be fun, it might be terrible. 79
<br><br>If it's terrible, we don't do it. 80
<br><br>If it's fun, we do more of it. 81
<br><br>Let me just go back to it,. I think that's our game, just a minute. 82
<br><br>But playing around with these design levers can make for 83
<br><br>totally different game experience without having to go and 84
<br><br>make an extra whole bunch of features is what I'm saying here. 85
<br><br>and as I've shown you a couple of examples here, when you prototype, that's 86
<br><br>what we're doing, you guys following along with Ben and I, we're prototyping. 87
<br><br>How exactly should our game be? 88
<br><br>That's a pretty common way to make your game. 89
<br><br>You don't know exactly how it's gonna be so you get in there and prototype. 90
<br><br>Go to the extremes when you prototype. 91
<br><br>Don't just change your main thrust to 60 and see how it goes, change it to 600. 92
<br><br>[LAUGH] Seriously, and make a game where you just have to tap it. 93
<br><br>If you do anything more than, 94
<br><br>whoop, tapping it, then your rocket's gonna be totally out of control. 95
<br><br>Or go to 600 and then jump into your camera and 96
<br><br>pull your camera all the way back. 97
<br><br>I might need to jump out of here, pull your camera all the way back to see how 98
<br><br>that feels, like way back here, turn this rocket up to 600 and then play that game. 99
<br><br>Maybe it's gonna be miniscule but it's going really fast so 100
<br><br>it's tiny rocket, whoa. 101
<br><br>And you know what, 102
<br><br>doing that is actually, there's something pretty compelling about it. 103
<br><br>And we just return those guys back to where they were. 104
<br><br>Hopefully, I'm gonna put that back to where they were, just check that. 105
<br><br>Whoop, yep. 106
<br><br>And then just need to put this guy back to 50 for now. 107
<br><br>We can play around with that. 108
<br><br>Set some examples of tuning, going to the extremes and 109
<br><br>thinking about your game not just exactly the way we're making it. 110
<br><br>If you wanna make it exactly the way we are, not a problem, that's great, 111
<br><br>that's fine. 112
<br><br>This is a learning journey but 113
<br><br>also make sure you guys are learning how to make a game that's gonna standout and 114
<br><br>be interesting, and different in everyone else's. 115
<br><br>So on that, I've got a challenge for you. 116
<br><br>This is a fun game design challenge for 117
<br><br>those of you who wanna flex your game design muscles, is pull 118
<br><br>some of your design levers to create something different to what we've created. 119
<br><br>And remember to commit to your repo beforehand, 120
<br><br>just in case you need to revert. 121
<br><br>So you can get in there, play with some freedom without worrying about, uh-oh, 122
<br><br>I've messed it up, and I'm not going to be able to get back to that. 123
<br><br>This is a lot of the reason that Ben's been helping me set up your repo. 124
<br><br>And then of course, share idea, if you come up with something, that you're like 125
<br><br>this, it's pretty cool, share it to the community, we'd love to see it. 126
<br><br>And you know what, have a go, play around with some stuff and when you come back, 127
<br><br>I'm gonna show you just very briefly one idea that you might not have even 128
<br><br>thought about. 129
<br><br>To just get the ideas flowing in a slightly different direction. 130
<br><br>So I'll see you back in a moment. 131
<br><br>Okay, something here, a design lever I didn't mention, 132
<br><br>is through that player, we've talked about the attributes of the player. 133
<br><br>But what if we had for example,. I don't know, another player in the scene. 134
<br><br>I call it player. 135
<br><br>I'm so used to calling it player. 136
<br><br>But what if we had another rocket-ship in the same. 137
<br><br>Let's call it rocket-ship. 138
<br><br>Maybe another one, and then maybe another one. 139
<br><br>Just well, I don't know, to see how it goes, see how it feels. 140
<br><br>So I hit play and then [LAUGH] they're all flying pretty uniformly. 141
<br><br>Once they stop bumping into this, if you think of when you play pinball, 142
<br><br>sometimes you have a few balls that are bouncing around. 143
<br><br>You have the multi ball moment, it's pretty fun. 144
<br><br>It's pretty cool. 145
<br><br>What if you had a situation here where you had multiple rockets and 146
<br><br>you had to get multiple rockets through and not just one? 147
<br><br>The more rockets you got, the better. 148
<br><br>So that's just something that an idea might spawn from this just by 149
<br><br>putting it in. 150
<br><br>Seeing if it's fun or seeing if it's silly, or seeing if it's interesting. 151
<br><br>But just an example of some extreme tuning that I've been playing around with myself. 152
<br><br>And if I was totally being extreme tuning with this, 153
<br><br>I wouldn't just put in four,. I'd put in probably 10 or 20 or 30. 154
<br><br>I have a quicker way to do this, click over there, Ctrl+D or Command+D. 155
<br><br>Duplicate it. 156
<br><br>I'm gonna do it one more time. 157
<br><br>I don't know,. I'm just being silly here, right? 158
<br><br>But just to show you, this is how we go about tuning, sometimes you do this and 159
<br><br>you discover something cool. 160
<br><br>Maybe your rockets are actually missiles and you're trying to blow something up. 161
<br><br>So there's an idea for you. 162
<br><br>Okay, undo all of this. 163
<br><br>[LAUGH] Ben would be like, why do we have 20 rockets in this scene here? 164
<br><br>Just for fun Ben, why not? 165
<br><br>Okay, there we go. 166
<br><br>So, great work you guys. 167
<br><br>I look forward to seeing some of the crazy, interesting, compelling, 168
<br><br>fantastic stuff that you guys come up with, and I'll see you in the next video.
