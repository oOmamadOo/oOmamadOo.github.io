[SOUND]. Welcome, in this video, 2
<br><br>we're gonna clean up our asset structure, and tidy up our project in general. 3
<br><br>We'll make everything a lot cleaner and more organized, as well as fixing 4
<br><br>a very interesting pre fab issue that. I created very early in our project. 5
<br><br>Let's jump in and get started. 6
<br><br>Okey dokey, let's go ahead and organize our assets. 7
<br><br>First thing we're gonna do is look at our Asset folder down there. 8
<br><br>Put a little bit of folder structure to it, so that it's not a big blob. 9
<br><br>As Ben pointed out, we can go and search by type servers. 10
<br><br>So for example, if we're looking for an audio clip, 11
<br><br>I can just click there to find audio clips. 12
<br><br>But as we get more and more and 13
<br><br>more and more audio clips that's not gonna be the best solution to go for either. 14
<br><br>So for now we'll add some folders. 15
<br><br>What I'll do is create folders by right-clicking on Assets or 16
<br><br>right-clicking anywhere in the area here. 17
<br><br>Or clicking on this Create tab, and jumping up to Folder. 18
<br><br>And we'll do one for levels,. I think we need levels and 19
<br><br>materials, scripts, particle effects and audio. 20
<br><br>I think that'd be good. 21
<br><br>Once I forgot levels here, 22
<br><br>we'll drop in these two level folders that were auto-created for us. 23
<br><br>These two scene files and this other sandbox scene file dropping in there. 24
<br><br>As Ben showed you previously, you can slide the slider, 25
<br><br>if you go all the way down here you, you get a nice long list 26
<br><br>of things to look at in terms of the words for things and not the icon. 27
<br><br>So I'll jump back here and grab the icon. 28
<br><br>So we've got levels. 29
<br><br>My next folder I will create will be. Materials and something interesting here. 30
<br><br>If you go over to search by type, and search for materials, 31
<br><br>then it'll show you all the materials we can highlight all of those, holding Shift. 32
<br><br>And then drag it over to our newly created Folder and look at it like, 33
<br><br>hang on a minute, they don't seem to have moved. 34
<br><br>They did, we're still searching for all of the materials in all of our assets. 35
<br><br>If we click on the materials folder here, 36
<br><br>then you can see that we've got those materials sitting there nice and happy. 37
<br><br>You might have also seen when I clicked over here, 38
<br><br>that it put in an interesting symbol, it said T colon materials. 39
<br><br>Whoop, material, my bad. 40
<br><br>So if you wish you can just type in to search, and then we could say green. 41
<br><br>If you had a lot of things that would be a way to find it. 42
<br><br>You don't have to go and click on the button over here. 43
<br><br>You could just type it all out if you want it to be fast or 44
<br><br>you have some sort of preset up going on there. 45
<br><br>Or you can do a particular search. 46
<br><br>For example, for rocket. 47
<br><br>And then you can click on the favorites star over here, and 48
<br><br>then it will add a new favorite for you. 49
<br><br>You can say Rocket. 50
<br><br>And then that will be an easy way to just quickly click on Rocket and 51
<br><br>get that search result. 52
<br><br>I'm just gonna undo that, or delete that. 53
<br><br>Cuz I don't tend to search for rocket a lot. 54
<br><br>So I don't want it messing up my assets, just at the moment. 55
<br><br>Also I'm gonna create a folder for audio. 56
<br><br>You might wanna call it Sound. 57
<br><br>That's fine, as long as it makes sense to you. 58
<br><br>And drag those into here. 59
<br><br>What else do we need? 60
<br><br>Particles, we can call it Particles or we can call VFX, standing for visual effects. 61
<br><br>For now, I'll call it Particles. 62
<br><br>That what's make sense just at the moment. 63
<br><br>Explosion Particle Success holding down control or command. 64
<br><br>I can grab a couple at once and pick the ones I want and drag into Particles. 65
<br><br>We want to remember our structure in here is exactly the same as it is 66
<br><br>in our projects. 67
<br><br>So if I go into my. Project Boost Repo folder area, 68
<br><br>click on Assets, then you can see there's an Audios, Levels, Materials, Particles. 69
<br><br>The folders I've just created are exactly the same as I've got in my project here. 70
<br><br>And within here, if I was to go and create a new folder for, 71
<br><br>say environments, environments, 72
<br><br>then that folder would automatically appear within my asset structure here. 73
<br><br>Because they're one in the same. 74
<br><br>This and what I can see in. Windows Explorer on my disc. 75
<br><br>So we've got environments, I'm gonna drag in there my back drop obstacles, 76
<br><br>the launch pads, and the terrain. 77
<br><br>I think that'll be good. 78
<br><br>Now I've got a few things left over, like my directional light, my main camera, and 79
<br><br>a couple of scripts. 80
<br><br>I'm not gonna put them in folders just for the moment. 81
<br><br>We access the scripts a lot. 82
<br><br>I would like to have them at the root level. 83
<br><br>And I think this is pretty tidy for where we are now. 84
<br><br>We'll have a different structure in other projects as it gets bigger, 85
<br><br>you kind of need a different lay up. 86
<br><br>For now this is what we need. 87
<br><br>Another quick tip I'll show you while we're here is if you find that your 88
<br><br>folders are taking up a lot of screen real estate, 89
<br><br>you can see there's not a lot of space going on. 90
<br><br>If you've got a big long lots of lots of folder and it's very deep, 91
<br><br>then you can rearrange your windows. 92
<br><br>So gonna go ahead and save my layout here so I can get back to it easily. 93
<br><br>I'll just call it Rick's Default. 94
<br><br>You can call it Rick's Default, if you want or you can call it your default. 95
<br><br>So that was just by clicking up in the top right up here. 96
<br><br>If I was to click on DSfault that's a different layout two by three 97
<br><br>a different layout. 98
<br><br>And if I go Rick's default that's back to where we were just before. 99
<br><br>And then, if I wish to grab my Project tab, and move it around a little bit. 100
<br><br>I'll move it over the left, and create, 101
<br><br>hold it in a way that creates a vertical structure, and bring it in. 102
<br><br>And then this is an easier way. 103
<br><br>I might even slide this all the way down so I can see my list. 104
<br><br>I've got lists of assets here. 105
<br><br>And if I needed to do some work, where I was. 106
<br><br>The manipulating things between my asset structure and 107
<br><br>my hierarchy, I can drag them easily. 108
<br><br>So then if this is pretty good,. I would save it as, 109
<br><br>save layout as asset view, save. 110
<br><br>And then I can easily jump between my default. 111
<br><br>Whoops, see if I click on it properly, my default is like that. 112
<br><br>I need more real estate to get to my assets then I can go to my asset view. 113
<br><br>And as we talked about in the past, 114
<br><br>there's another area that we need to keep tidy and that's our hierarchy. 115
<br><br>And this areas, we've already done a little bit of organizing here. 116
<br><br>You can see we've created our pseudo folder structure by 117
<br><br>adding an empty game object and then giving it a name. 118
<br><br>So folder type thing is what it becomes. 119
<br><br>It's always important as we've talked about, make sure you reset this so 120
<br><br>you know it's reset back to the 000 point. 121
<br><br>Now, we can drag things underneath that empty game object and then act as a fore. 122
<br><br>As I've done here for terrain objects. 123
<br><br>It could be that the terrain objects, well it's so 124
<br><br>many of them cuz I'm just saying duplicate, duplicate, duplicate. 125
<br><br>Than I wanna have a little bit more structure there, 126
<br><br>I could right click at the parent level, say create empty, jump in here and 127
<br><br>say, for example, left side, and it's already on 128
<br><br>the reset, and I could grab a certain number of these from the left side. 129
<br><br>I could even zoom out and actually grab them, make sure I don't grab my rocket. 130
<br><br>And then put them into or underneath the left side and 131
<br><br>then I've created a structure that way if I wanted to do that. 132
<br><br>I'm just gonna undo all this cuz I don't need to do this at the moment. 133
<br><br>Just want to just show you guys that that's a thing. 134
<br><br>Just gonna delete this empty here. 135
<br><br>And delete this folder type thing. 136
<br><br>Just showing you guys what you can do in there. 137
<br><br>The last part of tidy up that we really need to pay attention to is actually 138
<br><br>within our scene or within our scenes, cuz we've got multiple in there at the moment. 139
<br><br>And I made wonderfully silly error when I first set up my scene, 140
<br><br>some of you may have noticed it. 141
<br><br>And that was,. I was very willy-nilly where I grabbed 142
<br><br>a couple of the blocks that were already in the scene that Ben had set up. 143
<br><br>And I said, you know what? 144
<br><br>I'm just gonna duplicate this a few times, [SOUND]. 145
<br><br>And create all of my obstacles on the left, and tag it as the right thing and 146
<br><br>great, excellent. 147
<br><br>But recently when I got there and said, you know what? 148
<br><br>I'm gonna find my obstacle. 149
<br><br>I'm gonna make some changes to my obstacle. 150
<br><br>And as we've talked about prefabbing, 151
<br><br>because if everything;s linked to that obstacle, I should just be able to add 152
<br><br>a new material to this obstacle by clicking over here next to the color. 153
<br><br>Mix some material. 154
<br><br>Let's make it green. 155
<br><br>When I did that,. I can see that hang on a minute, 156
<br><br>clearly some of them changed to green. 157
<br><br>Now that's because a few of these. 158
<br><br>These ones over here I actually dragged the red over on top of those. 159
<br><br>But it's because some of them like these ones over here instantiated from 160
<br><br>a different prefab. 161
<br><br>Now if I was to click on this guy, and say, well I'll do it the other way around. 162
<br><br>If I was to say which of these had been instantiated from the obstacle and 163
<br><br>right click, that is a fine reference as in seen. 164
<br><br>It's only these ones that are stayed in color. 165
<br><br>But these others are coming from somewhere else, which is not so good. 166
<br><br>And the way to find where they're coming from, if I jump over, find that one, 167
<br><br>right click on it, and say select Prefab, it's coming from the launchpad. 168
<br><br>That's where I instantiated these from, which is not very good if I go and 169
<br><br>make changes that I think will be launchpad type changes that might go and 170
<br><br>make a mess of these as well. 171
<br><br>It will make a mess of these. 172
<br><br>And to see just the extent of that,. I can again, right click on here, 173
<br><br>find references in scene. 174
<br><br>I can see there's one, two, three, four, five, 175
<br><br>six, sevenish of these that are actually being instantiated from the launchpad. 176
<br><br>Not so good. 177
<br><br>Now Ben and I have spent a whole bunch of time looking to see if there was a good 178
<br><br>solution to how we can say, well, 179
<br><br>I'll just take this one instead of it being derived from the launch pad prefab. 180
<br><br>Have it derived from the obstacle prefab. 181
<br><br>There's not a good, clean way to do this. 182
<br><br>So the lesson here is,. Rick, just don't do it. 183
<br><br>Okay, so I've learned my lesson. 184
<br><br>I have indeed. 185
<br><br>If you say, well Bob, but I put a lot of time and effort and love into these. 186
<br><br>I don't wanna lose them. 187
<br><br>The best we can do is click on one of these objects and grab the copy component. 188
<br><br>And so click on the cog in the transform, copy component. 189
<br><br>And then I'm going to delete this object Drag obstacle into the scene. 190
<br><br>It's now green. 191
<br><br>And to Paste Components as Values, and 192
<br><br>then bloomp it goes to exactly where it's supposed to. 193
<br><br>And the reason that it's grayed out is I'm still searching for 194
<br><br>the ones that are being derived or instantiated from the launch pad. 195
<br><br>So if I Click X here that will take me back to normal and you can see that's now 196
<br><br>lovely, ugly green and that means it's being incsyncated from the correct prefab. 197
<br><br>And as you may have guess we're in Level 1, so 198
<br><br>if I wish to fix everything I need to do this for Level 2 and my sandbox, as well. 199
<br><br>And you can see how insidious this can become if I make this mistake. 200
<br><br>And then I duplicate a scene, and duplicate a scene, and 201
<br><br>duplicate another scene. 202
<br><br>This can be perpetuating through lots and lots and lots. 203
<br><br>So this is really one of those, just try not to make this mistake at the start. 204
<br><br>So it doesn't snowball into something huge. 205
<br><br>If you want to go through and fix it up, you can fix it up the way that I've showed 206
<br><br>your to fix it up here by going through one by one. 207
<br><br>Or you could just delete them, which I'm kinda tempted to do and say, 208
<br><br>that was a big silly thing to do. 209
<br><br>This one now is coming from the right place. 210
<br><br>I'm gonna actually drop in a new obstacle here and scale it up. 211
<br><br>And then hey, presto, that's kind of what I want to have over here. 212
<br><br>Over this side anyway. 213
<br><br>That's probably just a bit cleaner for our current project. 214
<br><br>And I'm gonna duplicate that. 215
<br><br>Then going through and saying, you know what, I'm gonna try to find them all and 216
<br><br>match them exactly. 217
<br><br>I wasn't that precious about where. I placed them down as it was. 218
<br><br>They're just kinda roughly there in the right place. 219
<br><br>And these ones over here because the material is not 220
<br><br>coming directly from the prefab. 221
<br><br>I think I'm gonna do the same. 222
<br><br>I think I'm gonna delete all of these And 223
<br><br>just put a whole bunch of new one in there. 224
<br><br>Like I said, I haven't put a lot of time and effort into the placement of it. 225
<br><br>I would just sort of, near enough is good enough. 226
<br><br>Which is a good time for us to jump over and for 227
<br><br>me to ask you to organize your assets. 228
<br><br>This is super important even if it seems a little bit nit picky, 229
<br><br>is to creat a folder structure that works for you in your assets folder. 230
<br><br>Tidy up your scene assets as I did with creating folders and 231
<br><br>putting them into the folders. 232
<br><br>And then make sure your prefabs are correctly link within your scenes. 233
<br><br>And then you can either do that by deleting and adding new ones or 234
<br><br>by copying the components and making sure everything is linked nice and neatly. 235
<br><br>And so jump in and do that. 236
<br><br>I'm just gonna take a minute to quickly organize mine so 237
<br><br>that you guys can see where I'm at. 238
<br><br>So do that, pause the video and. I'll see you in a moment. 239
<br><br>While I remember,. I'm going to change this back to red. 240
<br><br>I'm also gonna tweak the red while I'm here to make it slightly more orange, 241
<br><br>because I kind of want it a little bit more orange. 242
<br><br>There we go, just a little bit of a different look there. 243
<br><br>Okay, you can see I've just duplicated some over on the left, 244
<br><br>duplicated some over on the right. 245
<br><br>Pretty much the same as what I had and the same process we've been through before. 246
<br><br>So I don't need to show you every last step of it. 247
<br><br>But just created my level so it's the same as it was just with new pieces. 248
<br><br>So, well done, you guys. 249
<br><br>Well done for organizing your project and. I will see you in the next video.
