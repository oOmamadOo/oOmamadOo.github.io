[SOUND] &gt;&gt; So 2
<br><br>it turns out that some things in both two dimensions and 3
<br><br>three dimensions have a property called chirality. 4
<br><br>I'm just going to use the word different. 5
<br><br>It means they're different. 6
<br><br>So for example, for those of you who have played Tetris. 7
<br><br>We know that this L shape here is different to this L shape here. 8
<br><br>There's no way that you can rotate this guy in two dimensions to become this guy. 9
<br><br>It just doesn't work. 10
<br><br>Why do we care about this stuff? 11
<br><br>Well if you're making drug and you make your molecules run the wrong way, 12
<br><br>even though they've got the same molecules all 13
<br><br>connected together in seemingly the same way. 14
<br><br>If one's a mirror image of the other, at best the drug's gonna taste different. 15
<br><br>At worst it's gonna kill people. 16
<br><br>Also if we're involved into things like computer graphics and 17
<br><br>3D game making which we are, it can drive you completely nuts if you don't have 18
<br><br>a mental model that tells you how chirality or handedness works. 19
<br><br>So the basic difference here between say, this green block, 20
<br><br>which is the same as this green block in 2D because you can just rotate it to be 21
<br><br>the same and this L-shape is there's no line of symmetry on an L. 22
<br><br>There's no line along which you can create symmetry for an L. 23
<br><br>But there is for a block straight down the middle there, right? 24
<br><br>Now this turns out to be the same in three dimensions. 25
<br><br>Some things in three dimensions like your hands,, here's a hand labeled with 26
<br><br>coordinate systems matching those in unity, our 3D game package. 27
<br><br>And that hand is not the same as that hand. 28
<br><br>There's no way for 29
<br><br>me to rotate my right hand to make it exactly the same as my left. 30
<br><br>In fact, that's why you can't put a left handed glove on a right hand and 31
<br><br>vice versa. 32
<br><br>Now just different, okay? 33
<br><br>Not everything is different in 3D. 34
<br><br>A cube, anything that for example doesn't have mirror plane of symmetry. 35
<br><br>If you can't find a mirror plane of symmetry in 3D, then you can guarantee 36
<br><br>that the thing will be different to its mirror image, that it will be chiral, 37
<br><br>that it will have this property that you can't just rotate it 38
<br><br>to be like the thing that's the other version of itself. 39
<br><br>Get it?. So things have left and 40
<br><br>right handed versions. 41
<br><br>Now what does this matter, and how can we kind of use this practically? 42
<br><br>Well, if you take your fingers, 43
<br><br>which are beautiful chiral objects that you have attached to you all of the time, 44
<br><br>and you assume that the natural way to count is one, two, three. 45
<br><br>A thumb, forefinger, and a middle finger, one, two, three, like this. 46
<br><br>Then you can label your fingers one, two, three. 47
<br><br>And we can also assume that labeling axes, like our x, y, zed axes, 48
<br><br>behaves a bit like a clock, right? 49
<br><br>Is that you can go round in circles and it doesn't matter. 50
<br><br>So I can label this guy x, this guy y, and this guy zed, or any order. 51
<br><br>As long as I go in the same order that my fingers count. 52
<br><br>So x, y, zed or x, y, zed, or. I could go x, y, zed, doesn't matter. 53
<br><br>As long as you go in the same order that you count. 54
<br><br>So if we do that then we've set up handedness and 55
<br><br>kind of tied it to coordinate systems. 56
<br><br>Now with regards to just directions in your 3D package or in your game world, 57
<br><br>all this helps us do is just predict which way would be positive in a third axis. 58
<br><br>So if we already know this is x and we already know this is 59
<br><br>y then it It helps us predict that zed positive would be that way. 60
<br><br>Kinda handy, but most 3D packages gives you a very useful gizmo. 61
<br><br>I put one up in the corner of my screen that shows you which way x, y, and zed. 62
<br><br>It looks a bit like my hand. 63
<br><br>When it becomes really useful is when you want to think about rotations and 64
<br><br>when you wanna rotate something. 65
<br><br>So what you can do there, if you're gonna rotate say this block, 66
<br><br>then the axis about which I'm rotating it now this way. 67
<br><br>Imagine that you just stuck the axis through it. 68
<br><br>So say I stick my zed axis, my blue finger, [NOISE], 69
<br><br>through the block like that. 70
<br><br>It's gonna rotate. 71
<br><br>Positive rotation means this way. 72
<br><br>It means the direction of my fingers, you see? 73
<br><br>So I stab it with my zed axis. 74
<br><br>Positive zed means a rotation this way. 75
<br><br>And that is super handy. 76
<br><br>That means that when you go to write some coding, computer graphics, for example, 77
<br><br>you don't have to mess around and get it going the wrong way and the right way. 78
<br><br>You just go right. 79
<br><br>I mean, I'm in a left-handed coordinate system, I stab it in there. 80
<br><br>And that is the way my fingers go, so 81
<br><br>a positive rotation in zed would be like that. 82
<br><br>You could do the same for y, positive y would come around this way. 83
<br><br>And you could do the same for x and positive x would come around this way. 84
<br><br>Okay, so that's it. 85
<br><br>That is how you use these facts about handedness to help you work out what's 86
<br><br>positive, what's negative, what's clockwise, what's anti-clockwise in 87
<br><br>computer graphics, and even in making the world's next cancer drug. 88
<br><br>So thanks for watching and. I'll see you soon.
