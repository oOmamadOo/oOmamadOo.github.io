[MUSIC] 2
<br><br>In this video we're gonna create a second level which is gonna create a need for 3
<br><br>us to figure out how we join our levels together. 4
<br><br>So we go from level one to level two and 5
<br><br>we're gonna make our existing level look a whole lot spiffier. 6
<br><br>First of all, what I want to do is spend just a little bit of time making this look 7
<br><br>the way, well a little bit closer to how I want it to look, so 8
<br><br>beautifying it a little bit. 9
<br><br>I might speed the video up if this is taking a while, but generally you guys, 10
<br><br>I think you've got all the tools and 11
<br><br>knowledge that you need in order to do the same. 12
<br><br>So if you wanna follow along and do what I'm doing, that's cool. 13
<br><br>If you wanna stop the video and make your level look awesome, that's great as well. 14
<br><br>But what I"m gonna do is create a little bit of more feeling like I'm going through 15
<br><br>a caves or a cabin or a canyon, that's the word I'm after. 16
<br><br>A little bit more of a canyon, 17
<br><br>all I'm gonna do is just reacquaint myself with where the edge of my screen is. 18
<br><br>So it's a little bit pass the brown on either side here, 19
<br><br>what's this called, the earth on either side. 20
<br><br>So I'm gonna move one of these guys down to the end on either side, 21
<br><br>just to say this is the outer area. 22
<br><br>The launch pads, move my rocket up a little bit, launch pads I'm going to have 23
<br><br>them not just sitting on the ground, but have them up a little bit in the air, 24
<br><br>a little bit larger, a little bit more interesting. 25
<br><br>And I just hit F on the cable event, 26
<br><br>in case you're wondering why I went flying into it. 27
<br><br>And make it look a little larger, there we have an interesting starting point. 28
<br><br>So it's not super symmetrical, 29
<br><br>I'm going to have this guy a little bit lower I think, I'll see how it goes. 30
<br><br>I'll play around with this and. I'll move this. 31
<br><br>And I'll be doing a lot of, if you see a new thing just [SOUND] pop onto the screen 32
<br><br>that's me just hitting Ctrl+D or command D just to duplicate. 33
<br><br>So you see a lot of that going on at the moment that I'll do. 34
<br><br>And a little bit of organization I'm gonna do over in the side here as well. 35
<br><br>I'm gonna create a new empty game object, reset that back to 0. 36
<br><br>And then under, I'm gonna rename that to, what should we call it? 37
<br><br>The terrain obstacles. 38
<br><br>Basically my world, my environment is what I am creating here and 39
<br><br>I've grabbed the guys that I've got already. 40
<br><br>This guy and just drag it underneath this terrain obstacle so 41
<br><br>that I can get a nicer organization. 42
<br><br>It doesn't really matter the order in which they're down there, 43
<br><br>I just want to have these guys underneath here. 44
<br><br>Now if I was to click on this, 45
<br><br>click the check box next to where it says terrain obstacles. 46
<br><br>I could turn all those off and 47
<br><br>yes I've got all of those that I can see in my scene. 48
<br><br>So it's it a way to organize which is great, 49
<br><br>it's also a way to apply something in a large way. 50
<br><br>I can click on this high level, the parent level, and 51
<br><br>then I could move all of these if I wanted to do that. 52
<br><br>So rather than having things just kind of splashed around wherever, 53
<br><br>I'm gonna start to do that. 54
<br><br>So underneath here, and I duplicate this guy, what's that on there? 55
<br><br>That's one in the middle. 56
<br><br>This is the part that I might speed up. 57
<br><br>Now that I've told you that, I'm gonna be rotating, creating, scaling, duplicating, 58
<br><br>moving things around a little bit to make it a bit more interesting in my scene. 59
<br><br>So what I want you guys to do as well is to take some time, beautify your level. 60
<br><br>I'll do that, you do that, and then when. I'm done with mine, hopefully you will 61
<br><br>be done with yours, and then we can jump in to creating a second level. 62
<br><br>Okay, and I'm speeding this up now, and. I'll tell you what's going on as I do it. 63
<br><br>Just giving myself a little more room with the ground plane there, expanding it. 64
<br><br>Duplicating, adding some stuff on the left here to make some collision. 65
<br><br>Playing around with a little bit to see how I can get the ground looking a bit 66
<br><br>more like the collision and not just the straight up brown. 67
<br><br>Making a ceiling or a roof I guess so 68
<br><br>that the player knows that if they got there they bunk into it. 69
<br><br>They can't just go flying off up into the sky and making the most pan a bit bigger. 70
<br><br>Playing around with the camera as well, 71
<br><br>here I'm not sure whether I should move the ground plane down. 72
<br><br>So the brown ground down or 73
<br><br>move the camera, end up moving the camera down a little bit. 74
<br><br>Making the launch pad a little bit bigger, just moving things around, 75
<br><br>adding a little bit of detail. 76
<br><br>I wanna have it look angular, blocky, you know a little bit more like 77
<br><br>flying through a canyon, but. I'm not exactly sure on the art style yet. 78
<br><br>But just using primitives, that's what we're up to on this one, 79
<br><br>we're not going and making fancy shmancy art. 80
<br><br>And I'm trying to see what happens when I put the red down on the ground, 81
<br><br>it's even more obvious that it's collision. 82
<br><br>You can see that I keep going into the game and playing it. 83
<br><br>That's super important when you're making your level. 84
<br><br>Move things around a bit, play it. 85
<br><br>Move things around a bit, play it. 86
<br><br>Playing around here with the landing pad at the end. 87
<br><br>Trying to get it so that it looks like it's not just floating in the air and this 88
<br><br>extra obstacle I created in the middle is getting in the way of the camera so 89
<br><br>I have to adjust push that back a little bit. 90
<br><br>Not super happy with it,. I'm rotating it towards the camera. 91
<br><br>You can see here so that I can see it at a better angle. 92
<br><br>It's not taking up as much space. 93
<br><br>And as more obvious way and I'm gonna gonna collide with it when I'm not. 94
<br><br>So I'm reasonably happy with how this is looking, 95
<br><br>just a little bit of fine-tuning on the edges now, fine-tuning upstairs there. 96
<br><br>Putting a little bit more detail, there's a lot more detail I could do, but 97
<br><br>for now I'm pretty happy with how this looks and plays. 98
<br><br>We need to do a little bit more with lighting to make it really obvious where 99
<br><br>you can collide, where you can't. 100
<br><br>Maybe change the colors a little bit, so there's a few more things we can do in 101
<br><br>here but. I don't want to spend too much time. 102
<br><br>Just wanted to get something a little more indicative of, 103
<br><br>here's a look for our level. 104
<br><br>So let me go and make a second one, we've got something to base it on. 105
<br><br>So we've got now a level, pretty happy with it, looks a bit better, 106
<br><br>more work to do. 107
<br><br>But what I'm going to do is create a second level. 108
<br><br>The way we're gonna do that is by clicking on level one and duplicating that to 109
<br><br>create a level two and it's automatically named level 2 which is quite wonderful. 110
<br><br>And the reason we do it this way is that we have all of our camera and 111
<br><br>lights and rocket already set up. 112
<br><br>It's an easy way to get those things in there quickly of course because we've got 113
<br><br>them prefabbed, we could just drop them back in the scene. 114
<br><br>But here we've got all our stuff and we can start twiddling and 115
<br><br>tuning and creating this next level in the way we want it to be. 116
<br><br>Now if I double click on level two, you can see up here, Leve2.unity. 117
<br><br>We've automatically gone in there, but how do we know? 118
<br><br>It looks pretty similar, let me just change one detail in here. 119
<br><br>I will change this guy and move it all the way up and click save to save that, 120
<br><br>jump back to level one and it's down here, back to level two and it's up there. 121
<br><br>It's loading pretty quickly at the moment, which all the assets pretty much the same 122
<br><br>so it's going to help it load quickly which is great. 123
<br><br>Okay, so we've got a second level, what are we going to do? 124
<br><br>Well we talked about game moment, 125
<br><br>here's what we need to come up with a second game moment. 126
<br><br>I've got a ton of building blocks in here, so 127
<br><br>challenge to you guys is to create your second level. 128
<br><br>Duplicate your scene as. I've done just there and 129
<br><br>create a new level based upon a different type of moment. 130
<br><br>And if you're not so interested in the level design part of things, 131
<br><br>you can just go through the motion, duplicate it. 132
<br><br>Make sure you've got another level, because we're going to be challenging your 133
<br><br>programmer brain, i.e., Ben, to link those levels together. 134
<br><br>But it will be great if you come up with a second moment, a new moment in your level. 135
<br><br>Pause the video, have a go at that now and I'll show you, 136
<br><br>just in a little bit of time I'll show you what I've come up with. 137
<br><br>Okay, so checking that I'm actually in level two, 138
<br><br>I'm gonna come up with a thread the needle mechanic. 139
<br><br>So we did under, over, under mechanic. 140
<br><br>I'm not gonna spend a ton of time playing around with this. 141
<br><br>Just enough so 142
<br><br>you guys can see what I'm up to and so we've got a different set of mechanic. 143
<br><br>I'm going to grab these, stretch it on up, 144
<br><br>And for now I'm gonna lead the landing pads in pretty much the same spot. 145
<br><br>The targets, just plot that guy down. 146
<br><br>I'm gonna make a pretty crude, 147
<br><br>I think not too fancy, gonna do this sort of thread the needle. 148
<br><br>See if the player can fly through like that. 149
<br><br>Let's see how this goes, it might be a little bit ridiculous, 150
<br><br>but it's one of those, you just have to hover, okay. 151
<br><br>Ridiculously easy, but it's okay to have easy levels from time to time. 152
<br><br>How could we make this more challenging? 153
<br><br>Perhaps if the player has to float upwards as they go, 154
<br><br>that would add a little bit more challenge to this. 155
<br><br>And this guy down here as well. 156
<br><br>Up a little bit. 157
<br><br>Maybe a little bit tighter, a little bit closer. 158
<br><br>There we go, so it's a good old fashioned, just fly through the exhaust 159
<br><br>dock to blow up the Death Star, well something to that effect, okay. 160
<br><br>Let's see how this one feels, whoop, whoop, whoop, okay. 161
<br><br>Okay, that's a little bit, 162
<br><br>whoa okay, great, that's the right amount of challenge. 163
<br><br>Looks a little bit odd, but for now it's okay, we're still just seeing what works. 164
<br><br>We don't wanna go overboard with our art just yet. 165
<br><br>Because maybe people will play it and they're like, 166
<br><br>I kinda didn't like that level. 167
<br><br>In which case, you don't want to have over invested in an art style or 168
<br><br>making everything super polished and fine tuned, etc. 169
<br><br>So we're gonna make it not super fine tuned, just medium tuned. 170
<br><br>And I'm gonna finesse a little bit more with that perhaps, but 171
<br><br>I think that's pretty good for now. 172
<br><br>We've got two levels and the challenge we're gonna have next is joining 173
<br><br>those levels to make something that resembles a continuous game. 174
<br><br>So I'll see you guys again in an upcoming video.
