[MUSIC] 2
<br><br>Hey guys in this video we're gonna build, package our game, build it to the web and 3
<br><br>make a tiny gameplay preview video and then get it out there to the public. 4
<br><br>Or at least to some closed group like our groups that we provide you, so 5
<br><br>that you can get some actual feedback on your game. 6
<br><br>So exciting. 7
<br><br>We've come to that both nail biting and 8
<br><br>exciting part of the project where we get to share it with the public. 9
<br><br>Now some of you are gonna find this really difficult, maybe the introverts, and 10
<br><br>some of you are gonna find it really easy, maybe the extroverts. 11
<br><br>But regardless it's got to be done if we're gonna actually get our game out to 12
<br><br>players and get them to have some fun with it. 13
<br><br>Gonna make a personal sacrifice to get over the fear of sharing it. 14
<br><br>So regardless we have to technically do what we need to do first which is 15
<br><br>build the thing. 16
<br><br>So we're gonna go to build settings, make sure we've got WebGL build set. 17
<br><br>And then all of our scenes are in the build order in the order that we want them 18
<br><br>in the build order. 19
<br><br>There's not necessarily a particular order. 20
<br><br>Having said that I remember that one of these was a bit tricky. 21
<br><br>This one level 4 I would say is a bit tricky, so, what you can do, 22
<br><br>is you can move that level down the builder order, 23
<br><br>it doesn't have to be in the order that we have it here, in fact, you might want 24
<br><br>to rename your levels In terms of the, what the moment is all about. 25
<br><br>So we could call this Basic Flight, and 26
<br><br>then we could call this Level 2, what do we call this, what are we doing here? 27
<br><br>Up and Over, or something. 28
<br><br>And then Level 3 is easy gap. 29
<br><br>Now, before we go any further let's see what effect this is having on the build's 30
<br><br>settings here. 31
<br><br>You see they're all maintaining their order. 32
<br><br>So that's another option for you. 33
<br><br>Level 4 is thread the needle. 34
<br><br>And it's Level 4 that I think should be later, by the way, thread the needle. 35
<br><br>Level 5, I'm gonna call it Chompers. 36
<br><br>Anyway, the point is, 37
<br><br>you can label your levels different way if you want to, all right? 38
<br><br>And so you don't have to be encoding the build order in the level name order. 39
<br><br>Otherwise, what's the point of the build order? 40
<br><br>The reason I'm saying all that is because. I think the chompers is a bit too, 41
<br><br>is it chompers? 42
<br><br>No, thread the needle is a bit too difficult to be loaded, so 43
<br><br>I'm gonna move it down here, all right? 44
<br><br>So just wanted to say that's a different way. 45
<br><br>Anyway, tou have all the levels there, and make sure you got WebGL. 46
<br><br>If it's not WebGL, click on it, switch platform, we've done this before. 47
<br><br>Now we're gonna leave the development to build off. 48
<br><br>Now previously, we ignored that chain box but 49
<br><br>now we have a better idea as to what it does. 50
<br><br>It does more than what I've told you. 51
<br><br>But at least we know if that's off that we don't get those debug keys in it. 52
<br><br>Unless you want to do a build first and just check it using the debug keys, 53
<br><br>that's fine, just become aware of the debug build settings, and 54
<br><br>then we're gonna click on build and run. 55
<br><br>Now it's gonna ask us where to store it, as before, we've done all this before, and 56
<br><br>I'm gonna store mine in the root here of my downloads. 57
<br><br>And I'm gonna make myself a new folder and 58
<br><br>I'm just gonna call it Project Boost. Version One or something like that. 59
<br><br>All right, so in Project Boost Version. One Iâ€™m gonna save that as WebGL. 60
<br><br>And whatever, doesn't matter, as long as we end up with a ZIP file. 61
<br><br>Now, you've done this before, so. I would just like you to follow along and 62
<br><br>share your game. 63
<br><br>And them I'm gonna ultimately, at the end of this video, just challenge you to 64
<br><br>record a video of your gameplay and put this out on social media. 65
<br><br>So while we wait for this to build, let me talk about marketing your game, 66
<br><br>Marketing Your Game 101. 67
<br><br>The first thing is, put your best foot forward. 68
<br><br>Record a good bit of game play footage. 69
<br><br>Make it easy for people to play your game, 70
<br><br>rather than just saying, go to share my game.com and play the game. 71
<br><br>That requires them to click on a link they are not sure about. 72
<br><br>You got to entice them. 73
<br><br>So a way to make it easy is to make a short game play video. 74
<br><br>Maybe ask them a question to get them thinking. 75
<br><br>I'm going to ask the question,. Is there a difficulty spike? 76
<br><br>Or which level's the hardest? 77
<br><br>Or some specific question like that. 78
<br><br>You may want to say something like, how far can you get or whatever. 79
<br><br>Think about what's in it for them. 80
<br><br>Generally should be fun for them to play. 81
<br><br>Should be clear from the video will be fun but also be prepared for 82
<br><br>honest feedback depending on the group show sharing this in. 83
<br><br>You make a feedback you don't necessarily want right. 84
<br><br>They might tell you its circle something like that but if that's the case, 85
<br><br>it's not you they are insulting, its the product remember that and 86
<br><br>if they say that, you say thank you first. 87
<br><br>Don't just fight them. 88
<br><br>Thank you for that. 89
<br><br>Thank you for being honest. 90
<br><br>Really, honestly, thank you for being honest. 91
<br><br>What is it that I can improve? 92
<br><br>Now go, well this is rubbish. 93
<br><br>So you go away, fix it and come back and say okay, thank you. 94
<br><br>I fixed it, try again. 95
<br><br>Use negative feedback to make things better. 96
<br><br>So I want you to do, is to build and share with a 20 second video. 97
<br><br>We've built and shared in the last section, so you've done that before, but 98
<br><br>this time there should be a share on our community forum. 99
<br><br>In the forum under the CUT section, let me show you that. 100
<br><br>There is also a link, by the way, in the resources. 101
<br><br>I've got loads of resource links for you in this one one of them is here. 102
<br><br>In our community forum we have a showcase section so Unity to showcase. 103
<br><br>And there is a link to all of these things. 104
<br><br>So you'd wanna be putting in there, or and this is a logical also it can be both, and 105
<br><br>the more the better on our Facebook group or for 106
<br><br>live feedback try our discord chat server, or have at least with a friend or family. 107
<br><br>There should be &lt;= 20s of gameplay footage, and 108
<br><br>there should be a clear link to an online version. 109
<br><br>And remember to ask as simple question. 110
<br><br>So, go ahead post the video, go ahead and 111
<br><br>just do that and just kind of take a deep breath and get on with it. 112
<br><br>If you're nervous about it, and if you want these people allow it, enjoy it, 113
<br><br>enjoy sharing it with the public. 114
<br><br>All right, welcome back, let's get this done. 115
<br><br>So it looks like just in time my build has pretty much finished. 116
<br><br>I think it's just finishing off the build and spawning up a browser for 117
<br><br>me right now, which allows me to check the game looks right. 118
<br><br>Now I'm not gonna check this super carefully, I will check it though. 119
<br><br>So I am gonna pause the video in a moment and just check through this build. 120
<br><br>I encourage you to check through your build. 121
<br><br>It's a bit insulting to share something with people that doesn't 122
<br><br>really work properly. 123
<br><br>Obviously an early version of your game is gonna be susceptible to bugs an issues, 124
<br><br>but do them at least the justice of checking it through. 125
<br><br>It's like proofreading something, 126
<br><br>just make sure there are no glaring errors in it. 127
<br><br>Anyway, I'm gonna pause the video while we wait for this to finish building. 128
<br><br>All right, so. Unity has finished building that now. 129
<br><br>I think I have a browser tab that has spawned up. 130
<br><br>Here you go, we saw it spawn up a moment ago, let's just test. 131
<br><br>It's looking a bit blocky but it's good enough for the web. 132
<br><br>I'm gonna check my L doesn't work, good, 133
<br><br>we don't want the debug keys L or. C working. 134
<br><br>That seems to work, that first level. 135
<br><br>Sound is still working. 136
<br><br>Through the gap! 137
<br><br>Ooh, I'm being a ninja here on this particular instance. 138
<br><br>Wow, boom! 139
<br><br>Okay, let's try this one Rick. 140
<br><br>You beauty. 141
<br><br>Ooh! 142
<br><br>My god! 143
<br><br>So the tension builds doesn't it because you've invested all this time getting 144
<br><br>this far, and you really wanna get to the end. 145
<br><br>Cool, where are we? 146
<br><br>Bad camera here, bad camera. 147
<br><br>Okay, &gt;&gt; [NOISE] 148
<br><br>&gt;&gt; I think that's just about 149
<br><br>it acceptable. 150
<br><br>It almost adds to the game play that they've gotta work out where they are. 151
<br><br>I think that's good enough, the first few levels are there and we are good enough. 152
<br><br>So, what I'm gonna do is, I'm going to do what you know you have to do, 153
<br><br>which is to zip up this folder, compress WebGL. 154
<br><br>Go to www.sharemygame.com, also linked in the resources, or 155
<br><br>your other favorite game sharing website like Itch.io. 156
<br><br>Go and find that zip file. 157
<br><br>Where is it?. It's in here, oops. 158
<br><br>No, it's not. 159
<br><br>That's not gonna work. 160
<br><br>Let's try a different one. 161
<br><br>Go find your ZIP, which is in here WebGL.zip. 162
<br><br>It doesn't matter what you call it. 163
<br><br>Just make sure that your build folder is zipped. 164
<br><br>Let this load up.. Remember that you wanna make sure you keep 165
<br><br>this URL. 166
<br><br>Keep this URL very safe so that you know what you're gonna be sharing and 167
<br><br>where, and start your first post. 168
<br><br>So why don't I while I wait for that URL, why don't I start composing the post. 169
<br><br>I'm going to compose it in three places. 170
<br><br>I'm going to compose it in all of the places that I suggested you did. 171
<br><br>So here we go, we have GameDev.tv, 172
<br><br>Unity 2.0 showcase, and we are gonna say, 173
<br><br>Try The Official Project Boost, something like that. 174
<br><br>You're gonna write something different there. 175
<br><br>So, we're creating a topic, now if you lose your topic, unfortunately in my case, 176
<br><br>I just lost it. 177
<br><br>But new discussion, so you're in here. 178
<br><br>Let me just slow this down just a little bit. 179
<br><br>You come into the forum, you come to Unity 2, not Unity 1, showcase, the yellow tab. 180
<br><br>New Discussion up here makes a whole new thread, 181
<br><br>and you say. Try The Instructor's Project Boost. 182
<br><br>Okay, and then I'm going to start and. I'm ready to paste my URL, right? 183
<br><br>And I could form it here and then paste it into Facebook, whatever. 184
<br><br>I'm teaching you to suck eggs. 185
<br><br>So this is the URL. 186
<br><br>It seems to work. 187
<br><br>How are they going to know what keys to use? 188
<br><br>Well, ideally they'd be on the screen. 189
<br><br>We don't know how to do UI yet, so we better tell them in here. 190
<br><br>So boost with space, or just go something like this. 191
<br><br>Keys, and you can go ## to make it a title like this. 192
<br><br>Space = boost, A = rotate left or 193
<br><br>anti clockwise, D = rotate right. 194
<br><br>I'm gonna say something like Aim Fly 195
<br><br>to landing pad without hitting anything. 196
<br><br>Okay, suggesting alternative topics, you can dismiss that. 197
<br><br>Aim flight or landing pattern without hitting anything. 198
<br><br>And then I think I'm gonna put the URL at the very top. 199
<br><br>Okay, and let's see what kind of preview we get on the right-hand side. 200
<br><br>Here, Share My Game, easy way to share your game. 201
<br><br>Yep, so I think it should probably say Try Now, something like that. 202
<br><br>Okay, and then we're gonna have to get a video going, so a bit more work to do 203
<br><br>at the moment, but we've started to formulate our thingamajig. 204
<br><br>Now, how do you do a video? 205
<br><br>Well, we can get that from Unity, or we can get it from inside the browser. 206
<br><br>I'm gonna get it from Unity's Game tab,. I think. 207
<br><br>I'm gonna go to OBS. 208
<br><br>Now when it comes to recording your game play pick a fun level. 209
<br><br>Maybe this chompers one would be good it's nice and visual. 210
<br><br>And then we're gonna use OBS here which Rick has suggested before. 211
<br><br>I'm not gonna tell you how to set up OBS in totality because it's beyond the scope 212
<br><br>of the course. 213
<br><br>But I'm just gonna make sure a couple of things. 214
<br><br>I'm gonna make sure that I'm outputting as an mp4 because it's nice and common. 215
<br><br>And that I know where it's gonna be stored. 216
<br><br>And also I might want a hotkey for start recording. 217
<br><br>At least start recording and stop recording. 218
<br><br>What should we use there? 219
<br><br>I'm gonna go Ctrl+Shift+R. 220
<br><br>I'll see what happens there. 221
<br><br>So got a small piece of footage here that is good enough, so 222
<br><br>let's just try giving it a name. 223
<br><br>Project Boost 101 something like that, go and 224
<br><br>find a destination for it on the web so we're gonna use the forum here. 225
<br><br>In the forum keep the videos really small please, try and 226
<br><br>keep them under about five MG otherwise you'll fill up our forum. 227
<br><br>But what we can do is we can pop the video in. 228
<br><br>As I said try and aim for five megabytes or less. 229
<br><br>When it's finished uploading link it off to the share my game so 230
<br><br>that the video itself is clickable and you are good to go. 231
<br><br>Now you could do the same thing on Facebook if you wish. 232
<br><br>I won't bother right now. 233
<br><br>In the forum is good enough. 234
<br><br>But I would encourage you to do it in as many places as possible. 235
<br><br>You can see the focus of the upload of the video here. 236
<br><br>So please as I say five meg or less on that video would be great. 237
<br><br>Really short, really tight, really low res videos. 238
<br><br>So once the video is uploaded, you won't be able to make the video into a link 239
<br><br>easily but you could make the Try Now into a link. 240
<br><br>Plenty of links should be really clear when somebody reads this what you want 241
<br><br>them to do, to click here to watch that video, to click here. 242
<br><br>There are the keys and there we go. 243
<br><br>We have created it. 244
<br><br>We've put it out to the public and maybe you want to keep this URL on your desktop, 245
<br><br>or something like, 246
<br><br>that once it's published so that you can get back to it later if you want. 247
<br><br>You could drag and drop that there. 248
<br><br>So, congratulations on sharing your game. 249
<br><br>Gather your feedback over the next 24 hours. 250
<br><br>Ask specific questions and off you go. 251
<br><br>Now I didn't ask a question, so I can edit my post and say, which level is hardest? 252
<br><br>Something like that, okay? 253
<br><br>And I could bold that, whatever. 254
<br><br>So there you go,. I've completed the challenge. 255
<br><br>Please go ahead and complete the challenge for yourself and I'll look forward 256
<br><br>to patching up any feedback we get from people and observing their game play. 257
<br><br>Try and watch somebody actually playing this game.
