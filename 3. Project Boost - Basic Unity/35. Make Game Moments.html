<br><br>In this video, we're gonna be bringing it all together. 3
<br><br>We're gonna be talking about moments, your flow between your levels, 4
<br><br>and about sharing a specific moment with a community to make sure that you're 5
<br><br>game is standing out and people are digging it. 6
<br><br>So let's dive in. 7
<br><br>First of all, I wanna recap on where we're at in terms of creating a compelling game, 8
<br><br>and creating compelling game moments. 9
<br><br>So we've got all these design levels, so it can pull in terms of tuning, 10
<br><br>you've got your player movement, the speed of turning, the speed of thrust. 11
<br><br>You've got the camera position, how close, how far, what angle it's at. 12
<br><br>You've got the timing, such things as how quickly or how slowly the the level loads. 13
<br><br>You've also got visuals. 14
<br><br>The lighting, 15
<br><br>we talked about particle effects that provided some particle effects for you. 16
<br><br>We talked about materials and colors, intensity levels. 17
<br><br>Obviously, we've got the layout of the levels, moving objects. 18
<br><br>And in terms of the flow and progression, we'll have a conversation about that later 19
<br><br>on in this video, just about a couple of options that you've got in terms of how 20
<br><br>you want the player to progress through your levels. 21
<br><br>And then audio, the player movement, we've got some sound in there for 22
<br><br>that, the explosion, success, and ambiance as well. 23
<br><br>I'm gonna give you an example of that in this video. 24
<br><br>And I was mentioning level flow, let's touch on that just now. 25
<br><br>Level flow, it's important you've got variety for your players so 26
<br><br>they don't get bored. 27
<br><br>We need to keep our players engaged for as long as we can with our game. 28
<br><br>And there's two options with our current game and our current scope of features. 29
<br><br>And what we know in terms of the course, we've got two main options. 30
<br><br>One is, were gonna have randomized levels, that have similar level of challenge, 31
<br><br>it's where, the goal is to make through as many levels as possible and 32
<br><br>they keep mixing up. 33
<br><br>And then we have a second option, 34
<br><br>which is, sequential levels of increasing challenge. 35
<br><br>And this is more of a typical game where you go from a to b and 36
<br><br>then you complete the game. 37
<br><br>At the start, they're very tutorial-ish, they're very easy, and 38
<br><br>giving the player the opportunity to get a feel for the game. 39
<br><br>And as things go on, it gets more and more challenging, more and more difficult. 40
<br><br>And at the moment in our game, we can't load a bunch of levels, but Bandy's going 41
<br><br>to show you how to do that with level loading in some upcoming videos. 42
<br><br>Now, I'm not gonna take you through every last little bit of me building my levels 43
<br><br>out here, because it took me a couple of hours playing around, and thinking, 44
<br><br>and building. 45
<br><br>I'm gonna show you what I did, and you guys have all of the skills and 46
<br><br>ability to do that now. 47
<br><br>See how Level 1 we've had all along the camera got moved back a little bit. 48
<br><br>You've seen this a bunch of times, similarly, level two. 49
<br><br>One thing I was playing around with here, 50
<br><br>was a slightly different type of light to have a spotlight. 51
<br><br>And I wanted to show you guys something. I don't think we talked about in 52
<br><br>the lighting video. 53
<br><br>See, as I go through there, there's a shadow of my rocket ship. 54
<br><br>We find our light, let's go in here and find where this light is, 55
<br><br>spotlight I believe. 56
<br><br>Then, if you wish to have the player showing up as their shadow, when they move 57
<br><br>around, then you can change from shadow type to no shadows to hide shadows. 58
<br><br>If I turn shadows on. 59
<br><br>[SOUND] Which I might be able to do here while, yeah, there we go, 60
<br><br>as I'm blowing it. 61
<br><br>[SOUND] [LAUGH] As I'm crashing, then you can see the shadows,I think that's 62
<br><br>a really cool fix, something for you guys a play around with if you're going for 63
<br><br>this darker look that I've been going for in my game. 64
<br><br>Okay, let's go to look at the next stuff that I've doing here, level three. 65
<br><br>Not much to see here, just try try to make it through and try not to crash and 66
<br><br>then make it up to the top here. 67
<br><br>Level four, there's really no particular order, 68
<br><br>this is just me playing around prototyping. 69
<br><br>A lot of my point here is that, you can mix and match. 70
<br><br>So this is a great example of where,. I wanted to do a thread the needle. 71
<br><br>You can see, if I just bring the player over here, next to this obstacle 72
<br><br>that the player nearly fits between this two if they're straight. 73
<br><br>That's a really had maneuver to pull off. 74
<br><br>So what you need to do as a player is come through here at an angle, and 75
<br><br>it actually creates a really nifty moment I was pretty happy with. 76
<br><br>The pressure, if I can do it while I'm in here. 77
<br><br>Okay, if I. 78
<br><br>[SOUND] No. 79
<br><br>I didn't do it. 80
<br><br>One more try and then I'll just tell you guys what I'm trying to do. 81
<br><br>Okay, here we go. 82
<br><br>If I roll around like that. 83
<br><br>Anyway, I'm trying to roll around it, it's a way to get the plane to kind of 84
<br><br>somersault through the gap or just to shoot through there really fast. 85
<br><br>It's quite tricky and that's my goal for the lot of what I'm doing. 86
<br><br>There we go! [LAUGH] Persisted and it's quite tricky. 87
<br><br>It's just a thread the needle mechanic. 88
<br><br>And then also in this level I've got the oscillator applied to the landing pad, 89
<br><br>which makes it a little bit trickier. 90
<br><br>I can't just go boink and land on it. 91
<br><br>I have to wait until it's in the right position and then try to get it. 92
<br><br>So I found that kind of fun as a moment trying to actually hit the landing pad. 93
<br><br>Okay, maybe a little bit tougher than it needs to be. 94
<br><br>If you guys wanna see the values on that,. I just set that as 60 95
<br><br>on the z oscillation movement axis, and with a period of 6. 96
<br><br>Just so you're seeing that there. 97
<br><br>Okay, on to the next level. 98
<br><br>And here what I wanted to show you is that. I've joined together two game objects and 99
<br><br>created a moving challenge, 100
<br><br>where the player has to go between these two obstacles. 101
<br><br>So the way I do that was, jumped in here created an empty game objects 102
<br><br>just called it whatever I think I called it moving obstacle but moving obstacle. 103
<br><br>And then underneath that,. I can grab one obstacle. 104
<br><br>Let me just throw a couple into the world here so I can have one obstacle here, 105
<br><br>stretch it, manipulate it, and then duplicate that Up to here. 106
<br><br>Now, I've got these two, one and two. 107
<br><br>I've highlighted them both in the scene. 108
<br><br>I can drag them both underneath my moving obstacle empty game object, 109
<br><br>and then I will just make that a prefab. 110
<br><br>Apply the oscillator script to that, which I can drag over on to here. 111
<br><br>And then from there I can do whatever. I want if I make any sort of 112
<br><br>changes to these games objects here. 113
<br><br>This empty game object with this 280 then it will apply to all of those. 114
<br><br>And I did them offset so they are not all coming up at the same time. 115
<br><br>Cuz then they would all move at exactly the same point. 116
<br><br>And this particular moment, this challenge, is try to find the pattern of 117
<br><br>when you should fly through to make it through all of them. 118
<br><br>The next level similar kind of thing with movement. 119
<br><br>Again, I've created a pattern where the player needs to watch. 120
<br><br>This time you're flying straight along you're not trying to get through a gap. 121
<br><br>On the Y-axis, you can go anywhere high or low, but you're trying to pick 122
<br><br>the right moment to go shooting across based upon when these guys are, ooh! 123
<br><br>That's kind of cheating, smashing like that, but it works. 124
<br><br>The way I set these guys up with the oscillation, 125
<br><br>this I've got movement of ten with a period of four. 126
<br><br>This one, movement of 20 with 6. 127
<br><br>This one I've got 10 and 4, so it's the same as the first one and 128
<br><br>then this one's with 40 and 10. 129
<br><br>What I found worked well was to have these two pretty much the same or 130
<br><br>similar, and then to have these much slower. 131
<br><br>So that the players set their watch wall and try to figure it out. 132
<br><br>Okay, and then level seven, here's a moment that I created, 133
<br><br>I think it's really quite sinister and nasty, but fun where I had. 134
<br><br>A movement at the front in the foreground, which clearly is not hurting 135
<br><br>the player but covers up when you get to this moment here. 136
<br><br>You need to kind of hover without being able to see, and 137
<br><br>I think that's the first time. I've done that, first time. 138
<br><br>Excellent, you can have any color on here, but I just wanted to do that so 139
<br><br>I've blacked out the screen and then I've created a movement of 30, 140
<br><br>with a period of 4, just to create that. 141
<br><br>So these are examples, you guys don't have to put these into your game. 142
<br><br>But I just wanted to give you ideas of moments and 143
<br><br>of getting your creative juices flowing in terms of what you could do. 144
<br><br>And at the risk of this video getting way too long, 145
<br><br>I'm gonna show you two more things. 146
<br><br>One is that I've created an ambience, winged ambience and 147
<br><br>I'm gonna just drop into, better put in the right place, in audio. 148
<br><br>Dropping to audio here, this is provided for you guys, you can grab it. 149
<br><br>This is how you create music, or ambience, or ongoing sound effects in your game. 150
<br><br>It's super simple, all you need to do, drag this over into your hierarchy. 151
<br><br>And then find that game object. Wind_Ambiance, open up the Audio Source, 152
<br><br>Click on Play Is Awake, make sure that's checked on, and also Loop. 153
<br><br>There you go, and 154
<br><br>that is how you put music into your game in a very unsophisticated way. 155
<br><br>We'll do it more sophisticated later one. 156
<br><br>Music or ambiance, so now when I hit play, you might be able to hear it. 157
<br><br>It's doing a shh kind of noise, that's just going to be playing the whole time in 158
<br><br>the background no matter what's going on in the foreground, 159
<br><br>where all the sounds is happening. 160
<br><br>So that's a really quick and easy way. 161
<br><br>And you can play around with things like the volume, if you want to have it 162
<br><br>a little bit softer if it's competing with the other things in your scene. 163
<br><br>We are going to play around with audio and music and 164
<br><br>all this kind of stuff a lot later on in the course. 165
<br><br>But I just wanted to introduce that to you guys now. 166
<br><br>Obviously you need to go and drop in to everyone of your levels in exactly 167
<br><br>the same method that I just put in there. 168
<br><br>At the moment, it would only be in my last level. 169
<br><br>And the main point of this particular lecture, is I want you guys to be 170
<br><br>comfortable with the fact that moments of very important to share so 171
<br><br>you can get feedback. 172
<br><br>And so people can celebrate and so you can see what's going on. 173
<br><br>I'll show you a couple of moments from those that we've seen on 174
<br><br>the community so far. 175
<br><br>It's a really cool Mars-looking effect. 176
<br><br>If we look at Josh, he's created this really neat underwater effect. 177
<br><br>He's grabbed some assets and played around some volumetric lighting. 178
<br><br>Hopefully we'll get to that later on in the course. 179
<br><br>We've got from Lee, he's created a really quirky, weird guy. 180
<br><br>If you have the sound on,. I've turned it off deliberately. 181
<br><br>There is maybe a little fluctuation going on there from this guy. 182
<br><br>We've got from Cook Keg, he is really neat Rockety primitives 183
<br><br>with moving obstacles around that looks really neat. 184
<br><br>That's great work there and from these guys, 185
<br><br>they've created a video which makes it really, really useful. 186
<br><br>It's critical that you guys get into the habit if you wanna be an indie game 187
<br><br>developer and go through this process and do any sort of marketing, or 188
<br><br>get feedback is to be able to create a 10 to 15 second video as these guys done. 189
<br><br>And I recommend OBS, if you want a free simple approach 190
<br><br>OBS studio will allow you to do a screen capture to be able to show your game, 191
<br><br>capture your game and show your game. 192
<br><br>So OBS studio and I provided it download link for that in the resources. 193
<br><br>So over to the challenge. 194
<br><br>I want to you to share your best game moment. 195
<br><br>Obviously refine your Tuning, your Visuals, your Levels, your Audio. 196
<br><br>Put time and effort into those things that looks unique and interesting and 197
<br><br>specific to your game. 198
<br><br>And then create at least 5 levels, so 199
<br><br>that in the next video based on that level loading you've got enough levels to go 200
<br><br>through that mechanics of loading your levels. 201
<br><br>And then find what you think is the best 10 to 15 second moment 202
<br><br>within those levels. 203
<br><br>So I was showing you some moments that you can create with, 204
<br><br>here's thread the needle and here's going through the obstacles. 205
<br><br>Find your best 10 to 15 second moment in your opinion or ask a friend. 206
<br><br>And then capture video of that moment and this is a great habit to get into. 207
<br><br>It's a great skill to have. 208
<br><br>It's pretty easy to do. 209
<br><br>It doesn't need to be fancy. 210
<br><br>You don't need to do much editing. 211
<br><br>You don't need to do any editing. 212
<br><br>Just hit record, play your game for 10 or 15 seconds and then say stop and 213
<br><br>there it is and share that. 214
<br><br>So I'd love for you guys to share that in the community with us, 215
<br><br>share on our Facebook group, share on the forum, on our community site. 216
<br><br>Show us what you've got so that we can check it out and celebrate it. 217
<br><br>That's all for the design in this section of the course, well done you guys. 218
<br><br>And over to Ben to wrap it up with the last little bit of level loading. 219
<br><br>And I'll see you guys again real soon
