<br><br>Hi, welcome to Section 3, Project Boost. 3
<br><br>We're really excited about this section because it's going to be a really 4
<br><br>versatile and fun project for you. 5
<br><br>Rick, what are they gonna learn from a Unity and game design standpoint? 6
<br><br>&gt;&gt; Yeah, lots of Unity stuff in terms of really figuring out how prefabs work and 7
<br><br>the relationship between prefabs and game objects, and giving you some tips and 8
<br><br>tricks to make sure you don't get into trouble there. 9
<br><br>In terms of games design, we're making a game. 10
<br><br>And it's gonna be a cool game. 11
<br><br>We're gonna create the core of it, 12
<br><br>and then give you guys plenty of room to expand that in a lot of different ways. 13
<br><br>&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and when it comes to C#, there's not gonna be a huge amount of 14
<br><br>brand new C# in there from the standpoint of fundamental C#. 15
<br><br>But there's gonna be a lot of Unity specific C# and that's intentionally. 16
<br><br>The previous section was all about the foundations of C# without worrying 17
<br><br>about Unity. 18
<br><br>This section is all about applying your existing C# knowledge into Unity. 19
<br><br>And there'll be some very useful programming tips and tricks and 20
<br><br>paradigms as we go along. 21
<br><br>So the game is all about, it's a game called Thrust I used to play as a kid. 22
<br><br>And it's an evolution of that and a simplification of that. 23
<br><br>And Rick has really helped me to boil it down to the fundamentals to make it fun, 24
<br><br>whilst keeping the feature set low and tight. 25
<br><br>So, Rick, what was your thinking there about what we had to put in and 26
<br><br>what we left out? 27
<br><br>&gt;&gt; Well, at this stage we don't have a lot. 28
<br><br>As programmers, we don't know all the stuff just yet. 29
<br><br>We're learning. 30
<br><br>And so, to make the simplest aspect of a fun game, we need to get controls. 31
<br><br>And if controls are fun, if you can move a ship around on the screen in a really 32
<br><br>interesting fun way, then youâ€™ve got the basis of the game. 33
<br><br>And then as we complete further sections of the course, 34
<br><br>we can come back and add more elements in. 35
<br><br>We can add scoring later on when we know how to do that, or shooting at enemies. 36
<br><br>But, for now, it's focusing on, let's just get that core feeling really interesting. 37
<br><br>&gt;&gt; Yeah, and on the topic of going back and adding things, what were gonna do is, 38
<br><br>at the end of the course, we're gonna give you some opportunities 39
<br><br>to go back to previous projects and enhance them. 40
<br><br>For example, we've got an idea for you about how 41
<br><br>you could improve Terminal Hacker with what you learn in this section. 42
<br><br>But, for now, let's just crack right into. Project Boost and enjoy the journey.
