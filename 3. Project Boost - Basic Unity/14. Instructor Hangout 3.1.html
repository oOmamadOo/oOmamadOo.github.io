Hey guys welcome to another instructor hang out with me Rick and the other guy over there Ben.
<br><br>Hey you know and then I am doing superbly thank you very much indeed for asking me Rick.
<br><br>Wonderful.
<br><br>And we've been trawling through as trolling not trolling here.
<br><br>No I don't know.
<br><br>All right.
<br><br>Troll trawling see the actual calling like a ship or calling it rather than off the back of a boat.
<br><br>We've been boats and we're catching all these boats graces.
<br><br>So as many trawl along.
<br><br>So ketching other questions and comments and thoughts and problems and stuff you guys have been raising.
<br><br>Got a whole bunch of things we want to get through in this particular instructor hang out and the first
<br><br>one.
<br><br>Why not do it rather than unity CoLab just to move us on.
<br><br>Jason asks Why are we using it rather than unity CoLab.
<br><br>Good question because it is very very indices.
<br><br>Industry Standard we feel that by teaching you get you are going to be set up for more widely useful
<br><br>tool than unity CoLab unity CoLab is brand new.
<br><br>So yes basically there are reasons.
<br><br>Court.
<br><br>Very good.
<br><br>Read another question about handedness you guys watch what the videos have been trying to explain how
<br><br>he turns off his lights around the house and so is still there are they of.
<br><br>How exactly do I go away.
<br><br>I know in one of the videos you kind of had to a Bay Area.
<br><br>What's the final word on this subject.
<br><br>Well I think the final confusion is that it's just you must order your fingers in order you can't go
<br><br>you can't go like like this which is rude.
<br><br>You've got to go one two three.
<br><br>So it's the thumb the forefinger like a gun out and then this middle finger is the one pointing like
<br><br>that so as long as your hands like that on the hand you're good none of it none of this.
<br><br>Otherwise it won't work.
<br><br>So that's that.
<br><br>That's exciting.
<br><br>Thank you for that.
<br><br>We've had some people complaining that Macs are inferior at APC specifically that source tree is difficult
<br><br>to get on to the Mac.
<br><br>Anything you want to say about that at this point I don't think they were complaining that Macs were
<br><br>inferior to pieces.
<br><br>But let's not turn it into one of those discussions so thank you Frank.
<br><br>But they're not.
<br><br>Thank you Frank.
<br><br>But Frank I think he's using a Mac n cheese on the format it looks like he knows what he's doing.
<br><br>So just to say help each other out.
<br><br>It's great that you guys get on the form and help each other out.
<br><br>There's a good I've given you a few links against this video.
<br><br>If I just show you the links are one of them.
<br><br>Is this one here said the resource links have this be the first to post for adding a unity get ignored
<br><br>easily.
<br><br>Quite a lot of people talking about source control and it looks like they're both on Mac and p.c and
<br><br>even in other programs like get Kracken instead of saucery.
<br><br>So the moral of that is take a look on the forum and ask for help from each other and you guys are fantastic
<br><br>at supporting each other for which we are very grateful.
<br><br>Wonderful very excellent.
<br><br>Another thing we've found lots of people talk about pivot point rotation issues and I think it's good
<br><br>for us to do a little bit more of a reminder on that in terms of making sure that your pivot point is
<br><br>in the right place I think.
<br><br>Then you're going to fire up your screen and share that with us.
<br><br>I am in a second when I get a little bit more confident with these things here.
<br><br>So just to say things there we go find a place for our faces and off we go.
<br><br>So if we look at this rocketship right and we need to be very aware of whether we are in pivot mode
<br><br>or centre mode and if I hit the Z key you'll see it toggle between the two of them just want to clarify
<br><br>something.
<br><br>This pivot mode where that pivot appears depends on the relative position of all these children so if
<br><br>I select all the children of the rocketship and Rick by the way can you see my screen you probably cannot.
<br><br>I cannot that I am listening and understanding and absorbing.
<br><br>Okay so Rick is Rick is happy without seeing my screen.
<br><br>So if I select these child objects here and I moved the children up.
<br><br>Look what happens to the pivot point it is now down there.
<br><br>Where is the centre point if I hit Z is up at the top So that's generally how you fix your problems
<br><br>have your rocket ship wants to be at zero.
<br><br>Maybe some Y.
<br><br>You know its default.
<br><br>Its pivots.
<br><br>Why equal something but you want to be zero in the x 0 and Z.
<br><br>If I just pop those cuts child components back down again for a minute I'm going to show you where it
<br><br>how it calculates this centre.
<br><br>So if you clicked between the two if I take say a port booster and move it off to the side back to the
<br><br>rocket ship and then toggle between Centre and prevent look that's sent out to the left.
<br><br>This centre is the centre of gravity that unity is calculating assuming that all the constituent objects
<br><br>that have colliders on them which is motion and record talk about colliders in a second.
<br><br>Assuming all those objects have a equal density.
<br><br>So imagine they're just big blocks of concrete or something.
<br><br>Then the centre of gravity of the whole rocket including its port boost.
<br><br>That's off to the side would be better.
<br><br>So if I toggle the Z you can see that the centre of gravity is not at our pivot point.
<br><br>So one way of you getting the pivot point very close to the calculated centre of gravity is to just
<br><br>make sure that you move all your chandra objects up and down until when you're clicked on a rocket ship
<br><br>and you hit the Z key.
<br><br>You don't get much movement.
<br><br>Now if you want it to be precisely at the centre of gravity then a bad luck.
<br><br>We're not going to bother showing you how to do that in this section really doesn't matter is the point.
<br><br>The point is that it looks and feels right from a gameplay perspective but this will get you very close.
<br><br>All right.
<br><br>So hopefully that helps a little bit.
<br><br>Wonderful.
<br><br>Next we're going to talk a little bit about box colliders and I want to show you guys let me share my
<br><br>screen with you.
<br><br>Show something here in the U.S. Army.
<br><br>But you're a player here.
<br><br>If you click on the browse Q and A button you'll see what questions are already against this lecture.
<br><br>We can see any He has written a very quick comment at the start of it.
<br><br>He's got in these square brackets comment what we love is for you guys too.
<br><br>If you have a question is to write question and then your question in square brackets if it's a comment
<br><br>add comments give it something else you know.
<br><br>Put that in there.
<br><br>The prefix there and once it's solved if she can write solve in the prefix so that we can see that it
<br><br>has been solved that would help us a great deal if you can do that.
<br><br>Now to show you what you're saying about Rocket Ship falling over.
<br><br>Let's jump into unity.
<br><br>And I've got my rocket ship here.
<br><br>You can see that the green outlines he is sure that we've got box colliders So any point was he had
<br><br>a fully rounded bottom on the end of his rocket ship.
<br><br>Let's just take the nose cone here and pretend that's the bottom of our rocket ship.
<br><br>Now it's going to roll over because the collider is rounded.
<br><br>It's a sphere when it intersects with this this flat.
<br><br>You can see.
<br><br>Hopefully you can see that okay through this connection here means it's got its green line around it
<br><br>as well and it is Shyla Eileen or as green lines are.
<br><br>But if you just until Miss renderer for a second Rick and then you can you can you can see the box Collider
<br><br>in isolation that that is the one site that begun the rocket nose cone and mesh wrench.
<br><br>There we go.
<br><br>If you want it that you can see just the collider which makes it really clear.
<br><br>Yeah.
<br><br>There's just the collider that's what's going to happen here.
<br><br>So a solution to this.
<br><br>If you've got an issue where you're rocketships falling over because it's not flat when it lands on
<br><br>the landing pad then you can going create a box Collider for the entirety.
<br><br>You can turn this nose cone back on so we can see it and move it up to where it might be.
<br><br>You can create a box Collider for the entirety of your rocket add component and then type in box Collider.
<br><br>That.
<br><br>And then the controls and then move on.
<br><br>You have been using it to issue a box Collider.
<br><br>You can change the size or find the size of what's driving it.
<br><br>If they open your eyes can see this but change the size of it.
<br><br>The why is what I'm interested in so that the bottom of my box Collider is lining up so that when the
<br><br>rocket ship is coming down and colliding with the platform down here it all take into consideration
<br><br>is box Collider so long as I've gone and turned off this hoxha Collider.
<br><br>I think on the nose cone so that if I can fly in the box Collider won't be an obvious vehicle.
<br><br>Sorry it's a vehicle because it's a sphere then it's not going to collide with that at all because I've
<br><br>turned it off and it's going to collide with the collider that's on the rocket ship.
<br><br>The last point I'll add on this is there's a little of that area in here that's going to collide.
<br><br>You can see how there is that space that it would collide even if it's not touching the actual mesh
<br><br>in there.
<br><br>So you go and create two or three or four boxes and put them over the rocket ship to mould it to exactly
<br><br>how we want our colliders to look on our rocket so that's a super quick overview of you can add a collider
<br><br>to the the parent you're objects you just comment on there Rick if we're going to do this and put a
<br><br>collider over the entire rocket then you don't need colliders on any of the interior components because
<br><br>that's a point there's no point of them really.
<br><br>So I would potentially just remove them all.
<br><br>If you're going to do that yet remove and then Collider remove and so on so you go through and remove
<br><br>them also then you might just have this one Collider on the whole thing.
<br><br>Like I said before I probably have two or three colliders rather than having them on your own front
<br><br>for make the shape.
<br><br>Bear in mind that's going to affect the centre of gravity though because the centre of gravity is calculated
<br><br>from the colliders.
<br><br>The other thing to say Rick is if we look at that blue that blue circular thing at the bottom the other
<br><br>option is instead of it having a sphere Collider on it.
<br><br>The other thing that you could do here is take the sphere Collider component off altogether and then
<br><br>add a box Collider component instead.
<br><br>And that would achieve a similar thing but just on that some object so there's just another option for
<br><br>you.
<br><br>Lots of options.
<br><br>Wonderful.
<br><br>Very good.
<br><br>And we're going to be dealing with this a lot more in upcoming sections.
<br><br>But for now I just wanted to resolve that for any of you guys that are like why is my rocket ship keep
<br><br>falling over what can I do about it.
<br><br>Wonderful.
<br><br>Thank you Rick.
<br><br>And let's dive and let's see how we're doing right centreing the pivot point thanks to Rory for bringing
<br><br>that stuff up.
<br><br>Adding a box alive thanks to Andy prefix to cure questions and comments we've talked about that and
<br><br>bats.
<br><br>That's the bulk of it okay.
<br><br>Mad cow disease and that thousand year old text so what is all that about.
<br><br>Let me bring up the history here I want to just explain a little bit what I've been talking about all
<br><br>this time.
<br><br>So I went some time ago and saw all these links.
<br><br>By the way are in the resources so a chap called Roger Hamilton who's not on this page are you is there
<br><br>that Dylan spotting is for him talking about the wealth dynamics system which is him categorizing billionaires
<br><br>into their different ways of doing things.
<br><br>Now what I what I took away from this is a couple of things firstly he said that this was based on the
<br><br>eating so my depth of knowledge about why this is based on an old text again linked in the resources
<br><br>is just Roger Hamilton said it was so hands up that's all I know about it.
<br><br>Right.
<br><br>But what I've taken away from this is super handy and a save me a huge amount of time over the years
<br><br>is as follows.
<br><br>It is when you are asking questions you start by asking what what is this thing and understanding right
<br><br>in the middle if there's a heart.
<br><br>Why why do I care about the thing.
<br><br>Now what a lot of people do is instead of going clockwise around the circle they go left to how.
<br><br>Don't get mad how disease don't ask how to early because and this ties into what we talked about on
<br><br>the forum that is normally already somebody else who solved your problem.
<br><br>So who is the question to ask after what.
<br><br>What is it that I want to do.
<br><br>Why do I care.
<br><br>Who could help me with it then.
<br><br>The where and when he type questions down the bottom of the circle and then eventually you come round
<br><br>and ask how.
<br><br>And then you can repeat again refine your question and go again.
<br><br>The main point here is turn right ask rather than how when you want to do something get clear on what
<br><br>it is why you care and then ask somebody else to help you.
<br><br>Go for the HU.
<br><br>And in our case that ties into our forum et cetera.
<br><br>So that's what I wanted to say there.
<br><br>And there's a so there's a very tenuous link to this thousand year old text which is all linked in the
<br><br>forum.
<br><br>Check out what dynamics if you want.
<br><br>I'm not affiliated with it.
<br><br>I think it's a reasonably good test.
<br><br>It's a bit like Myers Briggs etc. but I'm not really pushing it.
<br><br>There's plenty of other systems out there but I've got a lot of benefit for me.
<br><br>So that's that.
<br><br>Anything else really you Rick that's all for this one.
<br><br>I think we've taken enough time and we'll see you guys in the next videos.
<br><br>And then in another instructer hang out in about 10 Videos time and we'd love to hear what you like
<br><br>about instructer hang ups where you don't like about instructer hang outs and everything else against
<br><br>this lecture.
