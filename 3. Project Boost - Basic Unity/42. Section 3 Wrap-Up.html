<br><br>Well done for making it through this section, you guys. 3
<br><br>You're doing great work. 4
<br><br>It's really cool seeing all of the projects that you're sharing, 5
<br><br>where your game's at, the moments you've been creating. 6
<br><br>For me, the highlight has been seeing levels come together in a continuous 7
<br><br>fashion, and really getting that continuity of game play going on. 8
<br><br>What about you, Ben? 9
<br><br>What have you enjoyed in this section? 10
<br><br>&gt;&gt; Most of it to be honest Rick, it's been fantastic fun. 11
<br><br>The game is so simple. 12
<br><br>We've really kept the feature set small, so that we can do it well, but it's so 13
<br><br>much fun. 14
<br><br>It's amazing what you can do with such a simple game. 15
<br><br>And you've learned a lot more about how to architect a slightly bigger project, 16
<br><br>little bit bigger than Terminal Hacker. 17
<br><br>You've learned a lot more about how to interact between C# and 18
<br><br>between Unity itself. 19
<br><br>So a lot of Unity specifics in C#. 20
<br><br>A load more tools in your tool set and. I think you're just doing great. 21
<br><br>I can't wait to see all of your creations over on the community side. 22
<br><br>&gt;&gt; And now is really a great time to push forward and jump into the next section. 23
<br><br>We've been, I know, we're super excited about the next section that's coming up. 24
<br><br>We've been talking that a lot, working on it a lot, getting some great stuff for 25
<br><br>you guys to work on. 26
<br><br>So, push ahead, keep going. 27
<br><br>Keep up with the momentum and we'll be seeing you in the next section. 28
<br><br>&gt;&gt; See you there, guys.
