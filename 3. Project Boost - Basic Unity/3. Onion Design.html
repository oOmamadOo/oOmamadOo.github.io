<br><br>In this video, I'm gonna introduce to you an incredible technique that will help you 3
<br><br>with common game design challenges that you face. 4
<br><br>Game design challenges such as, what features should I include in my game, or 5
<br><br>where should I even start, or what are my priorities, or 6
<br><br>what if I run out of time, or when should I stop working on my project? 7
<br><br>And that technique is the Onion design technique. 8
<br><br>If you're to take an onion and slice it right down the middle, 9
<br><br>you'll have a core of the onion and then you'll have outer rings of that onion. 10
<br><br>So, right in the very core of our game, we have what is 11
<br><br>the absolutely most important number one feature that we 12
<br><br>absolutely have to get created for our game is make any sense and be fantastic. 13
<br><br>And then, after we've created that, 14
<br><br>we move on to what is the next most important feature and we create that. 15
<br><br>And then after we have created that, we move on to what is the next 16
<br><br>most important thirrd most important feature and so on. 17
<br><br>And the important thing here is that every thing needs to feed the core and 18
<br><br>make the core better. 19
<br><br>Everything needs to keep coming back to the core. 20
<br><br>So let's link this, 21
<br><br>let's relate this to the game that we're working on at the moment. 22
<br><br>And to remind you of the core features and. I've even gone on and put in an putting in 23
<br><br>an extra couple of features in here that we could add on top of it. 24
<br><br>Then I've been pretty judicious, pretty careful in keeping our scope brief. 25
<br><br>But there's plenty of other things we can do in here, so we've got our shift, 26
<br><br>we've got our level, we've got controls, maybe we could also shoot. 27
<br><br>We've got a fuel mechanic we've got power ups moving obstacles got the level we 28
<br><br>got put on particle fix and make that game look beautiful. 29
<br><br>All these great things. 30
<br><br>So when we look at it we're like where do we even start? 31
<br><br>What's the important place to start? 32
<br><br>Iif we follow the anion design philosophy we say, what is the core of that game? 33
<br><br>The most important thing with our game that we just cannot do without. 34
<br><br>If we didn't have this thing our game would not work. 35
<br><br>And then after we get that and we implement it, we build it, we develop it, 36
<br><br>and we have it feeling the way we want it to feel. 37
<br><br>Then we go to the next, and then we go to the next, and then we go to the next. 38
<br><br>So, before I give you the answer to how we've gone about creating out Onion 39
<br><br>design for this game, I wanna ask you a question and that is a challenge I 40
<br><br>guess it is to sketch the Onion design that you think we're implementing for 41
<br><br>our game or you think we should implement for our game. 42
<br><br>Start off with what you believe is the single most important feature of the game. 43
<br><br>And then what's the next most important and what's the next most important? 44
<br><br>And just do a little, 45
<br><br>quick diagram to show how the Onion design would look for that. 46
<br><br>Take a moment to do that, pause the video and when you come back I'll show you 47
<br><br>what we believe is our sequence for our Onion design for this particular game. 48
<br><br>I believe the most important part of our game, 49
<br><br>the absolute most important part, is our movement. 50
<br><br>And this is the thing, that without that, the game just won't work, 51
<br><br>it will be no good. 52
<br><br>And I'm not just saying without it being in there, it falls down. 53
<br><br>Without it being interesting and compelling and engaging. 54
<br><br>So that's why we have to put number one priority into having our 55
<br><br>spaceship fly around. 56
<br><br>And our spaceship we're gonna have it rotate one way and rotate the other and 57
<br><br>we're gonna have it boost. 58
<br><br>We need to have the feeling really fun and compelling and exciting. 59
<br><br>And what's really cool is Ben and. I were working on that today and 60
<br><br>it was feeling really excellent. 61
<br><br>And then what comes next? 62
<br><br>I believe, because it feeds into movement and avoidance, 63
<br><br>our next most important aspect in having some sort of world collision, 64
<br><br>something to bump into in our game. 65
<br><br>Some sort of threat, something to avoid, something to dodge. 66
<br><br>Now for your game, 67
<br><br>you might not have put that as the next most important which is totally fine. 68
<br><br>You guys might want to create your game a little bit differently to ours. 69
<br><br>You're probably going to be following along with our flow, so you'll be a little 70
<br><br>bit constrained to what we're creating as we go through out the course. 71
<br><br>But this is flexing your design muscles. 72
<br><br>And then, the third most important aspect is our fuel mechanic. 73
<br><br>And again, why am I showing this to you guys? 74
<br><br>It's so we can make good decisions, and 75
<br><br>it's so we can say this is really really important. 76
<br><br>And when it comes time to working on the fuel, 77
<br><br>the fuel needs to make that more compelling than it already is. 78
<br><br>If we're putting in fuel and 79
<br><br>it does not make the core mechanic which is movement and avoidance, 80
<br><br>if it doesn't make it better, then it just doesn't get to go in our game. 81
<br><br>That is how you sort of make that scoping decision. 82
<br><br>So this is a great technique. 83
<br><br>This is how you make decisions. 84
<br><br>This is how you focus on the core. 85
<br><br>And I'm gonna be really honest with you guys, a lot of indie games, 86
<br><br>you just don't have enough time to do more than maybe one, or 87
<br><br>potentially two rings of your onion. 88
<br><br>And if you start building this, and building this, and building this, and 89
<br><br>building this, and building another couple of things at the same time, 90
<br><br>you'll find that you don't even get halfway through any of those. 91
<br><br>Before you've run out of time, or money or patience or whatever. 92
<br><br>So build this make it amazing, and then work to the next part, 93
<br><br>build this make it amazing. 94
<br><br>And at some point you're gonna say, you know, what my game is pretty amazing as it 95
<br><br>is, it doesn't need more complexity, this is good as it is. 96
<br><br>That's the philosophy we're taking on this project, 97
<br><br>that's what we're gonna dive into now, and get cracking on creating this game.
