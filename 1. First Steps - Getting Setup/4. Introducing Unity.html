<br><br>Back on Windows, during the installation process, lots of weird and 3
<br><br>wonderful boxes will have popped up while Visual Studio loads. 4
<br><br>And then you should have ended up with just the last box from Unity, 5
<br><br>where you've probably already clicked. Start Unity or something like that. 6
<br><br>And you'll end up with something like this, ready to sign into your Unity ID. 7
<br><br>Now If you haven't already done this, then do sign in to Unity. 8
<br><br>You could consider using a social login,. Google or Facebook. 9
<br><br>I'm actually quite a fan of social logins these days. 10
<br><br>I think it saves me from having to create lots of accounts on lots of 11
<br><br>different places. 12
<br><br>I only really then have to trust. Google and/or Facebook, and 13
<br><br>then I don't need to worry about storing other things. 14
<br><br>That said, I have actually got a unique email address for Unity. 15
<br><br>So I'm gonna use that and 16
<br><br>put my password in, but you either create an account or use a social login. 17
<br><br>Entirely up to you, you only have to do this once. 18
<br><br>You'll then be asked for your license. 19
<br><br>And by the way, the information is basically exactly the same on the Macs. 20
<br><br>So Mac users, you can follow the first half of this video. 21
<br><br>So Unity Personal is the edition we're using for the course. 22
<br><br>We're gonna confirm that we have earned less than 100,000 in 23
<br><br>the previous financial year. 24
<br><br>Actually, in our particular case, that's a slight lie. 25
<br><br>But Unity, I think are gonna be pretty happy with that in our case given how many 26
<br><br>students, how many tens of thousands of students we bring to them. 27
<br><br>I want to use exactly the version you're using, 28
<br><br>that's why I'm using Unity Personal rather than Unity Professional. 29
<br><br>If it all works, you get to this stage, thank you! 30
<br><br>You may need to go off to your email and confirm your Unity account. 31
<br><br>That will be quite a usual step. 32
<br><br>But there's nothing strange, nothing Unity-specific about this. 33
<br><br>I'm not gonna dwell on these details. 34
<br><br>Basically, sign up to Unity and log in, get the thing started, right? 35
<br><br>So let's start using Unity. 36
<br><br>Now here is your Projects tab. 37
<br><br>It's worth just taking a few moments to explain what happens when you set up a new 38
<br><br>Unity project. 39
<br><br>So I'm just gonna take you into my file system and 40
<br><br>show you firstly that. I've prepared a folder. 41
<br><br>I suggest you do the same thing. 42
<br><br>I've got a folder in my home directory here. 43
<br><br>I've then got repos, the repositories, Unity 2. 44
<br><br>The core thing is you create yourself a Unity course folder, or 45
<br><br>complete Unity developer folder, or something like that. 46
<br><br>And then we're gonna keep each of the different section's projects in 47
<br><br>those folders. 48
<br><br>This section's called first steps, so. I've got a folder called 1_first_steps. 49
<br><br>Why not 01 or 001? 50
<br><br>Well, it's just unnecessary in modern file systems, keep it simple. 51
<br><br>Now it's got a couple of files in it, in my case. 52
<br><br>But in your case, it can be absolutely empty. 53
<br><br>We'll understand what these files, 54
<br><br>like the gitignore and the readme do a little bit later probably in the course. 55
<br><br>But for now, you can have an empty folder. 56
<br><br>All right, so given an empty folder, we're gonna create a new project. 57
<br><br>And we're gonna choose where to put it really first. 58
<br><br>So we say okay, let's go find this folder that we just talked about. 59
<br><br>It is here, repos &gt; Unity 2 &gt; first steps, that is the folder. 60
<br><br>Now within the folder you choose, it's gonna create a subfolder, okay? 61
<br><br>So I'm gonna call it My Block Model. 62
<br><br>You can call it that, you can call it what you like. 63
<br><br>The challenge of this section, of this video, 64
<br><br>is gonna be to make a little block model. 65
<br><br>Now there are other options on this screen. 66
<br><br>We have 2D and 3D, it can be changed later, we're gonna go with 3D. 67
<br><br>You can add asset packages. 68
<br><br>Again, they can be added later, so don't add any. 69
<br><br>And you can enable or not enable. Unity Analytics, we just don't need it. 70
<br><br>So, as per usual at this stage in the course, leave everything as default. 71
<br><br>Just use a sensible folder in which of all your sections will go and 72
<br><br>give the project a name, okay? 73
<br><br>Now let's see what happens on disc after we allow firewall access. 74
<br><br>What's happening is Unity is making a project. 75
<br><br>It opens up, but let's just take a look back at the disc. 76
<br><br>Within the folder that we specified, we have something called My Block Model. 77
<br><br>That My Block Model is the Unity project folder. 78
<br><br>And within the Assets folder of that is where all the stuff we create is gonna go. 79
<br><br>Currently we've created nothing, so there is nothing in there. 80
<br><br>Okay, we set up a project, congratulations. 81
<br><br>Now let's take an overview of the Unity interface. 82
<br><br>Now just in case you've already got Unity installed, and 83
<br><br>that's great if you have and if you've been playing around with it really good. 84
<br><br>I encourage that. 85
<br><br>Just so that we're on the same page go to window, and then layout and 86
<br><br>default please, and that will allow you to have the same set up as me. 87
<br><br>Now if you're on a Mac, things are going to be very, very similar. 88
<br><br>Basically, you're going to have a bit of a difference around the help menu. 89
<br><br>Some of the things you can't find will be in a Unity menu on the Mac, but basically, 90
<br><br>it's almost exactly the same. 91
<br><br>So the general layout is thus. 92
<br><br>We have on the left-hand side, a hierarchy, if we're in the default view. 93
<br><br>By going to help, our window rather layouts and default, 94
<br><br>what we've done is we've specified how all these tabs lay out. 95
<br><br>Hierarchy, scene, game, asset storing, inspector, all this stuff. 96
<br><br>That's all part of the default view. 97
<br><br>Now we can move these things around, we can drag and drop and 98
<br><br>make a mess and basically customize this work space to how we wish. 99
<br><br>And you're welcome to do this, and have a fiddle. 100
<br><br>But the point is, and do battle, do make a mess, do fiddle, do play with things. 101
<br><br>Do allow yourself to break things, that's how you learn. 102
<br><br>Because we can reset the layout by going window, Layout default, all right. 103
<br><br>Let's get you back to this kind of point of safety. 104
<br><br>We'll fiddle with the default once we understand what things do, right. 105
<br><br>So what do we got. 106
<br><br>Hierarchy and scene are the two things. I wanna bring your attention to first. 107
<br><br>Let's just go to game object, 3D object cube, like this. 108
<br><br>And we're gonna make a game object. 109
<br><br>The whole game comprises these things called game objects. 110
<br><br>It's a 3-D thing, and it's a cube. 111
<br><br>If you do that, you should end up in a situation something like this. 112
<br><br>Now, the thing I want you to note is that everything that is in the scene, 113
<br><br>currently a light, a camera, and a cube. 114
<br><br>And they can be clicked on in the scene. 115
<br><br>Is also reflected in the hierarchy. 116
<br><br>So we have untitled star, now what is that mean? 117
<br><br>That's the name of our scene. 118
<br><br>A scene is a collection of gameobjects. 119
<br><br>So to have a scene you need a camera, a light, and 120
<br><br>at least one thing in the world. 121
<br><br>And in this case, the thing is a gameobject is a cube, okay? 122
<br><br>That is the scene. 123
<br><br>Now it currently says untitled star, why? 124
<br><br>Because we have not saved the scene. 125
<br><br>In fact, if we look in the header bar, there's another clue. 126
<br><br>Unity, it tells us the edition, untitled is the name of the scene. 127
<br><br>Then my block model. 128
<br><br>One project, like my block model, can have multiple scenes. 129
<br><br>We're only going to be dealing with one scene at the moment. 130
<br><br>But what I wanna do is save the scene. 131
<br><br>So File &gt; Save Scenes. 132
<br><br>It's gonna ask us for a name. 133
<br><br>We're gonna call it car for example. 134
<br><br>Okay, so now we have this scene saved. 135
<br><br>We know that because at the top it says car.unity and 136
<br><br>in this hierarchy on the left, we have car. 137
<br><br>And if we expand it out, these are all the things that are in the car scene. 138
<br><br>There's another tab I want to introduce you to, Project. 139
<br><br>And this talks about all the assets you have in your game. 140
<br><br>If we look back at the disk, an asset is something that's written to the disk. 141
<br><br>Forget metafiles for now, just overlook them. 142
<br><br>But the car is the Unity scene file. 143
<br><br>So this is the first thing we've actually made. 144
<br><br>We made, we had a Unity two folder, this is the name of the section first steps. 145
<br><br>My block model is the Unity project, so this is what's interesting. 146
<br><br>These folders here we can totally ignore about these library project settings, 147
<br><br>they actually can be safely deleted. 148
<br><br>But don't delete them, but they could be safely deleted. 149
<br><br>The thing that matters is the asset folder and we've made an asset. 150
<br><br>Cuz we made a scene, it couldn't be any simpler. 151
<br><br>It's just a car in the world, but we've made a scene. 152
<br><br>Okay, so that's the organization. 153
<br><br>A project, my block model, contains one or 154
<br><br>more scenes, like this car scene, or we could call it a different scene. 155
<br><br>You could click on it and name it. 156
<br><br>We could call it street scene. 157
<br><br>That would be more interesting, so there you go, I've renamed it. 158
<br><br>Just by clicking on it in the Projects tab and 159
<br><br>then wait until it goes blue and rename it. 160
<br><br>So now we have a street scene. 161
<br><br>If I save that to disk with Ctrl + S or. File &gt; Save Scenes. 162
<br><br>Look back at the disk you'll see it's now street scene on the disk. 163
<br><br>Awesome.. So 164
<br><br>all the information about what we've done here and 165
<br><br>how we've positioned this cube, that's where it's saved. 166
<br><br>So what I want you to do is now start playing with the cube. 167
<br><br>You can move this in loads of ways. 168
<br><br>You can grab the red arrow. 169
<br><br>That will move it along what we call the x-axis, which depending on how your 170
<br><br>camera's rotated, will probably be in the direction you can see. 171
<br><br>If you're ever not sure where things are, look at this thing at the top right. 172
<br><br>It orientates you.. If you've got a middle mouse wheel, 173
<br><br>hold it down now, try moving around, well it does. 174
<br><br>It turns into a hand and moves around. 175
<br><br>If you've got a right mouse button [INAUDIBLE] if you have, you can do this. 176
<br><br>While the right mouse button is down, there is a hint on the screen. 177
<br><br>There is a little upside down triangle looks like a tetra space. 178
<br><br>That's telling you to put their fingures on WSA and 179
<br><br>[INAUDIBLE] standard control keys with your left hand. 180
<br><br>And that allows you while you're holding the right mouse button to move it around. 181
<br><br>Just do this stuff, experiment. 182
<br><br>You can roll the mouse wheel in and out. 183
<br><br>If you're on a Mac and you haven't got a mouse wheel, 184
<br><br>you can do similar things on the track pad. 185
<br><br>But frankly, you know what? 186
<br><br>If you're on a Mac, I hate to say it, but it's probably worth just grabbing yourself 187
<br><br>a standard three button mouse with a wheel for this course. 188
<br><br>So as soon as you're into the course and you're thinking yeah, I like it, 189
<br><br>I enjoy it, and consider doing. 190
<br><br>You wanna find other ways of doing things, you can go to help and 191
<br><br>you look for the keyboard shortcuts. 192
<br><br>Now where is that gonna be? 193
<br><br>It gonna be in the Unity manual and 194
<br><br>you click of to that, it will open on the web your favorite browser. 195
<br><br>And then in there you'll be able to find things like keyboard 196
<br><br>shortcuts in a very standard way. 197
<br><br>So just get used to the program just like you would any other. 198
<br><br>All right, the things that I wanna specifically focus on are these tools at 199
<br><br>the top here. 200
<br><br>There's five keys, which [INAUDIBLE] to Q, W, E, R, 201
<br><br>T on your keyboard, okay, Q-W-E-R-T. 202
<br><br>And Q puts you in this mode, which just moves your view port. 203
<br><br>It doesn't move the camera in the scene. 204
<br><br>We'll talk about the camera and how that affects at the moment. 205
<br><br>But this scene view is like a kind of God view that just let's you see what's in 206
<br><br>the scene regardless of what the player might see. 207
<br><br>It just let's you move around freely. 208
<br><br>So the hand lets you move. 209
<br><br>The next one on the W key lets you move objects. 210
<br><br>When that's on, you get this object selection. 211
<br><br>You can move it in specific axes with the colored arrows. 212
<br><br>Or you can grab the planes, i.e., the little yellow plane or 213
<br><br>the blue plane, or the red plane. 214
<br><br>And that lets you move it in one of two axes. 215
<br><br>So if you wanna move things horizontally, you grab that green plane, 216
<br><br>it stays on the floor. 217
<br><br>All right? 218
<br><br>E, now e is interesting, it lets you rotate. 219
<br><br>You can just kind of click on the thing or if you want to rotate along a specific 220
<br><br>local access, i.e., relative to the cube, grab the little circle around it. 221
<br><br>Now if this doesn't behave how you see it behaving for me, 222
<br><br>make sure you have local selected up here. 223
<br><br>Global is different that means relative to the world, to the floor you see there. 224
<br><br>Local means relative to the cube, let's just leave it default in local for now. 225
<br><br>So you can rotate and you can also scale. 226
<br><br>Again, green will scale on one axis, red in another, blue in another. 227
<br><br>All right, and the thing in the middle will scale in all axes at the same time if 228
<br><br>you drag on it, awesome. 229
<br><br>The last one we're gonna leave, it's to do with user interface and 230
<br><br>we're gonna forget about it. 231
<br><br>So I have a challenge for you,. I'm gonna delete the cube. 232
<br><br>You click on it in the hierarchy or in the scene view and 233
<br><br>hit the Delete key, or right-click and Delete. 234
<br><br>Gonna make a new cube just to show you how that's done. 235
<br><br>And I'm gonna start suggesting that you get your hands used to the left-hand side 236
<br><br>here for scaling, etc. 237
<br><br>And that you scale up this cube and add another one. 238
<br><br>And then when you add the other one, 239
<br><br>what I want you to do is start thinking about making a car, okay? 240
<br><br>I'm not gonna do anymore right now. 241
<br><br>Experiment using cubes, and cylinders, and 242
<br><br>whatever else you like from here to make yourself a car. 243
<br><br>So it's challenge time, make and share your block model. 244
<br><br>You've made a creation. 245
<br><br>So, why am I wording it like this. 246
<br><br>I'm wording it in terms of the outcome. 247
<br><br>That's what I'm trying to do for you here. 248
<br><br>I'm trying to say at the end of this challenge, you'll have known you 249
<br><br>succeeded because you'll have made a creation from primitive shapes. 250
<br><br>Your other students can see your work. 251
<br><br>Well, we talked about in the last lecture how we achieve that using the all various 252
<br><br>communities. 253
<br><br>I suggest you use the community forum for this one. 254
<br><br>And at least one other student has your encouragement. 255
<br><br>And that bit's important. 256
<br><br>If you're gonna expect to have the students to give feedback on your work, 257
<br><br>then please go and find other students work and give feedback on that. 258
<br><br>Try mark it your self a little bit. 259
<br><br>Try and make it interesting. 260
<br><br>And go ahead and make something really simple. 261
<br><br>Get into the habit of sharing. 262
<br><br>Get into the habit of actually stopping and doing these challenges as you go. 263
<br><br>And I'll see you in a second. 264
<br><br>Awesome, nice to have you back. 265
<br><br>So I'm quickly just gonna put my car together now. 266
<br><br>So I'm gonna scale simply the, what I'm gonna use as the body. 267
<br><br>It's gonna be a very simple kind of crossy road style car I'm gonna do here. 268
<br><br>I'm not gonna obsess about this at all because you're gonna learn nothing 269
<br><br>particularly watching me do this. 270
<br><br>But I'm just gonna show you a few things. 271
<br><br>You can name these game objects. 272
<br><br>You see where I put cube here at the bottom. 273
<br><br>You could just name that base or something like that. 274
<br><br>And then we could name this piece here by double-clicking on it slowly. 275
<br><br>Top and then we can create a new game object, 3D object cylinder. 276
<br><br>Then I'm going to use a rotate to pull that cylinder around. 277
<br><br>Now you could set it to perfect rotation, if you've noticed up in the inspector, 278
<br><br>but I don't want to be talking about that and 279
<br><br>confusing you guys with that at the moment. 280
<br><br>These things don't really matter. 281
<br><br>All that matters is it's visually good enough for the moment. 282
<br><br>All right, there's enough for you to learn here if you're new to this 3D environment 283
<br><br>without worrying about numbers and inspectors and all that sort of business. 284
<br><br>Let's just get it looking visually about right. 285
<br><br>Okay, so here's a hint, once you've got a wheel, if you then name that wheel. 286
<br><br>So if you really wanna go learn something else, you can go wheel bracket zero. 287
<br><br>Because if I click on it, and. I've to go edit duplicate or 288
<br><br>I go right-click duplicate or. I go control on the [INAUDIBLE] command D. 289
<br><br>It's gonna name the next wheel, wheel one if I have started the other one with wheel 290
<br><br>space open brackets zero [INAUDIBLE]. 291
<br><br>If I do it specifically like that, then I'm gonna get a nice naming, and 292
<br><br>I can just drag the second wheel out. 293
<br><br>Pretty cool. 294
<br><br>Now spacing, and naming, and things, very, 295
<br><br>very important when we get to the coding site. 296
<br><br>So I'm gonna suggest that you do do this just as an exercise in attention 297
<br><br>to detail, and 298
<br><br>that you do it exactly like this, every space, every bracket precisely the same. 299
<br><br>It actually doesn't matter at all here in Unity, but 300
<br><br>when we get to the code side it will. 301
<br><br>So there we go, wheels zero, one, two, three. 302
<br><br>And why am I counting from zero? 303
<br><br>Well, that's another thing that's gonna prepare us for coding. 304
<br><br>We normally start coding,or counting rather at zero when we're inside code. 305
<br><br>Spaces matter, brackets matter, so start getting used to that. 306
<br><br>So there you go. 307
<br><br>That is your [INAUDIBLE].. Those of you who know something about 308
<br><br>Unity might be asking why I'm not somehow grouping these things together. 309
<br><br>Hold your horses, that's for a future video. 310
<br><br>The purpose of this one was literally just to get you to a block model car like this. 311
<br><br>Yes, there are ways to color these things in. 312
<br><br>If you really wanna go in and look and fiddle around, you could find that, but 313
<br><br>I suggest you don't. 314
<br><br>I suggest you keep it as simple as this. 315
<br><br>If you wanna highlight the whole lot and 316
<br><br>kind of drag it upwards, [LAUGH] that's interesting. 317
<br><br>See if you miss a bit, it gets disjointed, 318
<br><br>but if you highlight the whole lot and. Ctrl + Z of course, will take you back. 319
<br><br>Haul out the whole lot and drag it upwards. 320
<br><br>If you want a slightly prettier view, 321
<br><br>you wanna get it up in the sky before you photograph it. 322
<br><br>You can do that.. Now how are you gonna take a screenshot? 323
<br><br>Well, there are lots of different ways. 324
<br><br>On a PC, you can simply hit print screen. 325
<br><br>On a Mac, there's various different ways of grabbing the screen. 326
<br><br>I suggest Snagit, I will leave a link in the resources for you to Snagit. 327
<br><br>It ranks it very easy and it's free to actually take screen captures and 328
<br><br>then you can set up a keyboard shortcut and use that. 329
<br><br>And I would use snag it but you can use print screen and 330
<br><br>you could use grab on the MAC, what ever. 331
<br><br>Get yourself a screen shot being resourceful, paste it into the community. 332
<br><br>So you can follow a link from the lecture on the game deck community site 333
<br><br>as I showed you before. 334
<br><br>And take a bit of time just to comment on somebody else's creation. 335
<br><br>Some people would have spent hours on this and done amazing things. 336
<br><br>And I will look forward to seeing you in the next video.
