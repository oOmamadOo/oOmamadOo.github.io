[MUSIC] 2
<br><br>In this video, I'm gonna basically help you to use the course. 3
<br><br>I'm gonna start by explaining why we're downloading Visual Studio, then we're 4
<br><br>gonna dive in and look at the resource links we have against the lecture. 5
<br><br>And then we're gonna go through and see about the udemy Q&amp;A system, 6
<br><br>how that works. 7
<br><br>We're gonna have a look at the Facebook group, at our Discord live chat server. 8
<br><br>And also at our very, very busy community site, 9
<br><br>one of the best things about this course. 10
<br><br>By the end of this video I will be talking very fast and getting very excited. 11
<br><br>So remember that if you have trouble understanding what I'm saying 12
<br><br>you can slow the video down. 13
<br><br>And also we will be adding closed captions to the course very soon after 14
<br><br>it's been developed. 15
<br><br>So look out for the closed captions, look out for the slowdown facility. 16
<br><br>And please excuse my enthusiasm and enjoy the class. 17
<br><br>Just want to start by explaining why you're even downloading a separate program 18
<br><br>Visual Studio. 19
<br><br>Why can't we just do everything in Unity? 20
<br><br>Well we can do most things in Unity but when it comes to writing code, 21
<br><br>Visual Studio is something called an IDE, integrated development environment. 22
<br><br>And it makes writing code much, much easier. 23
<br><br>Makes it faster, 24
<br><br>makes you less likely to make mistakes, makes your life a lot easier. 25
<br><br>So we'll see a lot of that as we go through the course, 26
<br><br>I just wanted to explain why we're downloading this thing. 27
<br><br>And also the general pattern about how they relate while they're both hopefully 28
<br><br>still downloading in the background for you. 29
<br><br>Maybe they're even finished and you're keen to crack on this. 30
<br><br>If so this video won't take long, but it does contain important information. 31
<br><br>So the general pattern is that Unity, you create your code files inside Unity. 32
<br><br>It makes a .cs, for C# file, on your disk. 33
<br><br>And then once it's on your disk you can open it and 34
<br><br>edit it in Visual Studio to your heart's content, save it back to the disk. 35
<br><br>And then Unity will use the file for making amazing game behaviors and things. 36
<br><br>So we'll see that all in action. 37
<br><br>I just wanted to explain why you need a separate program to make your life easier. 38
<br><br>All right let's move on. 39
<br><br>How do you get help? 40
<br><br>At this stage, you may have challenge with downloading one of those packages, 41
<br><br>you may have some questions. 42
<br><br>And even if you don't, we'd like to get you introduced to our massive community. 43
<br><br>We've got over 280,000 students in total and tens of thousands of 44
<br><br>those students are on our community site and our Discord chat server. 45
<br><br>So how do you know where to go for what? 46
<br><br>Well the pattern is simply this, 47
<br><br>if you have a question that needs an answer, use the udemy Q&amp;A. 48
<br><br>The answer's in the title really, 49
<br><br>the questions and answers section and make it really easy for people to help you. 50
<br><br>Use code formatting if you're gonna paste code, take screenshots and images. 51
<br><br>Really give people as much help as you can, 52
<br><br>to help them reproduce your problem and work out how to give you help. 53
<br><br>Imagine you were trying to help somebody else, really make it easy for people, 54
<br><br>you'll get the best response that way. 55
<br><br>Pop it on the udemy Q&amp;A. 56
<br><br>And if you're still stuck and you want some real time feedback, 57
<br><br>come over to our Discord chat server. 58
<br><br>Now I'll show you in a minute when we go through the resource links against 59
<br><br>this lecture. 60
<br><br>But we have an online chat server with typically between 1,000 and 61
<br><br>maybe 2,000 people simultaneously online and ready to help you. 62
<br><br>But it really helps if you slowly write out and 63
<br><br>carefully write out your question first on udemy. 64
<br><br>Then you can paste the link to them or something, and just say look guys, 65
<br><br>come and help me with this. 66
<br><br>At least you've thought it out first, and you've tried to help yourself, 67
<br><br>often just by writing the question out, you actually solve it. 68
<br><br>It's called the rubber duck syndrome, which is about the idea that sometimes, 69
<br><br>you can problems just by having a rubber duck literally on your desk and 70
<br><br>talking the problem through. 71
<br><br>Now if you don't need an answer, if this is just opinion or 72
<br><br>if it's sharing your work. 73
<br><br>And we love people sharing their work. 74
<br><br>Then you want to come to our community site, community.gamedev.tv. 75
<br><br>Again there is a link in the resources, we'll look at the resources in a moment. 76
<br><br>And over there, fantastic place for sharing and boasting and giving opinion. 77
<br><br>And possibly asking for help, but don't expect a student, or sorry, 78
<br><br>don't expect an instructor to respond necessarily over the forum. 79
<br><br>We just don't have the bandwidth for that. 80
<br><br>So the way that our support works is that we have a student 81
<br><br>instructor on this course on udemy. 82
<br><br>That student instructor will do the first triaging, 83
<br><br>all your other students will try and help you as well. 84
<br><br>And if the problem is either systemic, ie, we need to adjust the course and 85
<br><br>we make thousands of edits to this course. 86
<br><br>If the problem's systemic, we will make edits to the course and change the course. 87
<br><br>And if it's a problem that is just one off but too difficult for 88
<br><br>other people to solve we will dive in and help as well. 89
<br><br>So this is the channel that we monitor and 90
<br><br>we make sure the questions eventually get answered. 91
<br><br>Over on here we, of course, are very, very participating that'll do. 92
<br><br>We're very active in the community site, but 93
<br><br>we don't promise to answer all questions over there, 94
<br><br>which is why we prefer you to ask questions in the udemy Q&amp;A. 95
<br><br>If once you've posted something on the community site like some screen shots or 96
<br><br>something you're proud of. 97
<br><br>You want more feedback again, 98
<br><br>go over to Discord with your link and beef up some real time discussion there. 99
<br><br>But it does make sense to go to these two places first. 100
<br><br>All right, hopefully that makes some sense. 101
<br><br>So what I'd like you do, is go find the resource links against this lecture. 102
<br><br>Choose one of the places that you can go and activate. 103
<br><br>You can go and, what am I trying to say? 104
<br><br>You can go interact with the community. 105
<br><br>All of these are free and optional. 106
<br><br>So the first option is you go to the udemy Q&amp;A. 107
<br><br>If you are gonna use just the udemy. Q&amp;A for chatting to other people and 108
<br><br>introducing yourself, that's fine. 109
<br><br>But if you just reply to your own topic immediately, and 110
<br><br>mark your ought reply as top answer. 111
<br><br>That really helps us, we really want to only be looking for 112
<br><br>things that don't have an answer, questions that don't have an answer. 113
<br><br>Really better for 114
<br><br>this sort of thing with engaging in the community is to use community facilities. 115
<br><br>Firstly we have our free community forum site based on a system called discourse. 116
<br><br>Confusingly, different to Discord. 117
<br><br>And that is actually a site made by the guy who started Stack Overflow, 118
<br><br>Jeff Atwood. 119
<br><br>Amazing site, big forum, we have over 10, 15,000 visitors per day, 120
<br><br>or page views per day on that site at the moment, and growing. 121
<br><br>So please come and use our community forum or go to the Discord chat server, 122
<br><br>I put an invite link over in the resources. 123
<br><br>Or come to our Facebook group and that's a very active and 124
<br><br>very friendly Facebook group as well. 125
<br><br>You have to wait a little while to be approved into that but it won't take long. 126
<br><br>So lots of answers for you now. 127
<br><br>Always when it's or, I always mean the real logical form of or which is one or 128
<br><br>the other or both. 129
<br><br>So those of you are introverts maybe be a little bit scared of, 130
<br><br>not that introverts are scared. 131
<br><br>But maybe you're an introvert, or 132
<br><br>maybe you're scared that you're introducing yourself to the wide world. 133
<br><br>This is a great stretch goal for you. 134
<br><br>And of course, we've got a whole bunch of extroverts and 135
<br><br>very sociable people out there who will just go to all of these places and 136
<br><br>say hi everywhere, that's great. 137
<br><br>But if it is difficult for you, stretch yourself, and at least just say hi, 138
<br><br>this is where I am in the world and whatever you want to share. 139
<br><br>Whatever information you want to share on at least one of those channels. 140
<br><br>So pause the video, take a look at the resources, go find our community channels, 141
<br><br>and try and participate. 142
<br><br>Okay, welcome back, so let's just see how you get to this stuff. 143
<br><br>So it would be something like this. 144
<br><br>The interface, again, may change. 145
<br><br>But you will, against each video lecture, have resources. 146
<br><br>Now this video, How To Use This Course, has four resources. 147
<br><br>Be careful of the show more, one is the lecture discussion. 148
<br><br>Let's take a look at that, click on Lecture Discussion. 149
<br><br>Now this is our discussion forum, when you click on 150
<br><br>that from any video it takes you not only to the Unity 2.0 area of the forum. 151
<br><br>By the way the top level forum looks something like this. 152
<br><br>When you get there maybe a little different cuz this old Unity course will 153
<br><br>have gone and we will just having the new Unity 2.0. 154
<br><br>But it takes you to the forum, which is organized by course, 155
<br><br>in our case Unity 2.0. 156
<br><br>And then within the course, we have a lecture tag for every single lecture. 157
<br><br>And the way to get to exactly the right place is just to click 158
<br><br>This Lecture's Discussion. 159
<br><br>Every single lecture discussion link is different and 160
<br><br>takes you to a different place. 161
<br><br>Now this forum is free for anybody to read. 162
<br><br>If you want to write into the forum and 163
<br><br>participate, you need to log in with some form of social log in. 164
<br><br>We don't ask you for your user name, email address etc but 165
<br><br>please use GitHub or Google or. I can't remember what else we've got. 166
<br><br>We've got a few others on there, Facebook and Twitter, those sort of social log ins. 167
<br><br>They're safe and secure and it saves you from having to create a new account. 168
<br><br>Then come along here and this is the topic that relates to this particular. 169
<br><br>This is the topic area that relates to this particular video. 170
<br><br>You can either read other people's topics here. 171
<br><br>There'll be multiple topics in the future, or 172
<br><br>you can start a whole new discussion about this video. 173
<br><br>We know that it's about this video because it says, 174
<br><br>Unity 2.0 First Steps is the section name. 175
<br><br>And this thing here is our unique reference to this video. 176
<br><br>And then this is the exact video. 177
<br><br>So this whole thing here represents the video. 178
<br><br>And this is a list of discussions on our community site 179
<br><br>about this particular video. 180
<br><br>This is the place to come in and participate in an existing topic which 181
<br><br>will be listed down here or to create a whole new topic or discussion yourself. 182
<br><br>That's the community site, worth it, it's huge, it's busy, 183
<br><br>it gets a huge amount of engagement. 184
<br><br>Look for instance at our blender forum here, 185
<br><br>with 312 new posts per week, great place to be. 186
<br><br>All right next resource,. Discord chat survey. 187
<br><br>If you click on that, you will get an invite to our GameDev.tv official server. 188
<br><br>And now you will have to sign yourself up. 189
<br><br>I'm already a member, so there's nothing to see particularly interesting there. 190
<br><br>You can either use the web interface, or you can use the app, 191
<br><br>it's entirely up to you. 192
<br><br>Why don't you start with the web interface, it works fine. 193
<br><br>And if I come on here, here we go. 194
<br><br>#lounge, maybe a place to introduce yourself 195
<br><br>if you just want to say hi in general. 196
<br><br>If you're about Unity, maybe go to #Unity. 197
<br><br>You'll get used to how this place works. 198
<br><br>Everyone's really friendly, and. I'm just going to prove it. 199
<br><br>Hey everyone, I'm live, recording Unity 2.0. 200
<br><br>Say hi, okay so that's live then. 201
<br><br>Now if we look on the right hand side, you'll see we've 202
<br><br>got 1,559 people currently online, right now able to help you. 203
<br><br>So if you follow my little recipe over here, 204
<br><br>which is that you really think about your question, write it out. 205
<br><br>Do the other people the service of just thinking about what you're gonna say 206
<br><br>before you say it. 207
<br><br>Pop the question if it's a question on udemy or the shared discussion, 208
<br><br>whatever screenshot, whatever you're gonna share over on the forum. 209
<br><br>Grab those links, come over to Discord and 210
<br><br>then the magic will happen cuz these people are gonna say hi. 211
<br><br>They're all friendly, they're all great, it's all light and really, 212
<br><br>really amazing community. 213
<br><br>One of the biggest benefits of you being on this course is that you can get 214
<br><br>immediate, live feedback. 215
<br><br>You'll see at any time people giving themselves specific help with Unity, 216
<br><br>with C#, technical DEV questions, it's all here. 217
<br><br>This is the place to get the real time help. 218
<br><br>All right, to keep this lecture short, let's move on to the next thing. 219
<br><br>We talked about the community forum, we talked about the Discord chat server. 220
<br><br>Let's go on to the next resource, which is the Facebook group. 221
<br><br>Let me just show you that,. Facebook Unity Course Community. 222
<br><br>Here it is and again, a very busy group. 223
<br><br>Lots of people sharing their work, what they've done with the course, 224
<br><br>lots of questions and polls and we're pretty active in here too. 225
<br><br>So please come and join this group. 226
<br><br>It'll take you a little while to get approved but once you're in, 227
<br><br>I think you'll really enjoy our Unity course community Facebook group. 228
<br><br>And finally there is the udemy Q&amp;A rather. 229
<br><br>So that's when you've got a question against a particular lecture, 230
<br><br>you browse the Q&amp;A and you ask a new question against the lecture in question. 231
<br><br>You come along and you put in a sensible title, stuck with this, or 232
<br><br>help with the other. 233
<br><br>If you're gonna put code in please format your code like so, highlight it and 234
<br><br>click this little code formatting. 235
<br><br>Use images liberally, and yeah, enjoy using the format. 236
<br><br>And when you've got your question answered, 237
<br><br>please mark one of the answers as a top answer. 238
<br><br>Or if this is my question, what you could also do, 239
<br><br>which will prevent people unnecessarily clicking into the question to try and 240
<br><br>help you, is just put solved, like that. 241
<br><br>So then, people don't need to look in the list of questions, 242
<br><br>we don't need to go in and answer solved questions. 243
<br><br>Lots to talk about there hey, 244
<br><br>so hopefully that has given you an idea of an overview of how to use the course. 245
<br><br>Basically, the more you put into this course, 246
<br><br>the more you will get out of it is what I wanted to put across. 247
<br><br>You put the extra effort in, 248
<br><br>you'll get the good results out and you're gonna have a great time with it. 249
<br><br>So I'm really excited to see your transformation. 250
<br><br>Please, please, if you haven't done the challenge already, come and 251
<br><br>say hi on at least one of these community sites. 252
<br><br>Friendly bunch as I say, if I have a look back in lounge, there we go, 253
<br><br>some of which blah blah blah people saying they're willing to help. 254
<br><br>They're looking forward to the new course, come and be one of them, 255
<br><br>1,500 of us lurking around. 256
<br><br>I look forward to seeing you on there and. I will see you in the next video.
