It's a very quick video that I've inserted because I found people that had a few issues with Visual
<br><br>Studio.
<br><br>You don't need to be doing anything in this video you don't need to be writing the code it's oldest
<br><br>example to make my point.
<br><br>And the problem that some people are getting is when they go to type things within Visual Studio for
<br><br>example typing debug they're not getting this auto complete they're not getting all this extra information.
<br><br>And so if I hit the full stop here or the period then it finishes the word debug I can see it changes
<br><br>color and you can see how I get all these other options as the next thing to type.
<br><br>So I can type log so alone it knows to auto complete.
<br><br>So that's what I'm talking about.
<br><br>If you're not getting that behavior if you're seeing problems if things aren't opening properly in Visual
<br><br>Studio then I've got a checklist for you.
<br><br>If everything's fine at the moment you can skip this video and continue on with the course.
<br><br>But just remember it's here.
<br><br>If you do have issues in the future so here's a checklist for you to fix Visual Studio problems.
<br><br>First of all try restarting unity and restarting Visual Studio of course and then also ensure that Visual
<br><br>Studio is your external editor.
<br><br>What I mean by that.
<br><br>Well let's hop over into unity.
<br><br>Again this is just a blank project.
<br><br>I've started up to illustrate the point here.
<br><br>What you want to do is come up to edit preferences or go down to preferences in the middle of the thing
<br><br>you here preferences and then we click on external tools and Laura says external script editor we want
<br><br>to make sure that his visual studio 2017 or whichever Visual Studio you're using as part of this course
<br><br>but I'm using 2017.
<br><br>Make sure that is the correct one is selected in their next point that you can try to fix problems.
<br><br>That's just another way to find that is to check that the unity dev tools are installed in Visual Studio.
<br><br>For that we go within Visual Studio.
<br><br>We go to Tools and then extensions and updates so into visual studio over into tools and then extensions
<br><br>and updates up near the top there.
<br><br>And you can see the very first thing that I have installed is Visual Studio 2017 tools for unity.
<br><br>So we need to have these unity tools in there if that is not in your list of things that are installed
<br><br>that could be the reason you are having the problem and then you need to go and find through online
<br><br>to search for the unity Visual Studio basically Visual Studio Tools for unity is what you need a search
<br><br>for and find if you don't see that in your installed tools.
<br><br>The next thing you can try if you're having issues is to check that the script is included in the project.
<br><br>So to do that within Visual Studio we open up our solution explorer.
<br><br>So we find under.
<br><br>Let's see and view solution explorer click on that or you can do control old L if you're on a P.C. and
<br><br>you can see here is showing us all of the things that should be within our project.
<br><br>So all the things that Visual Studio says aha I'm going to pay attention to these things.
<br><br>And within unity I've got one script that I've set up called test.
<br><br>That's the one I'm doing just for this video and you can see here that test is one of the things that's
<br><br>listed in all of the things that visual studio thinks is in my project.
<br><br>If I right click on that you can say I have an option to exclude from the project if I exclude it and
<br><br>I need to save the changes first.
<br><br>So that's cool if I exclude it then you can see it has this kind of dotted line pattern around it.
<br><br>That means that Visual Studio is not going to recognize that the way it should when we go and open that
<br><br>up from unity.
<br><br>It's going to be a little bit confused a little bit upset about what's going on.
<br><br>So here we go.
<br><br>It's not going to do the right kind of behavior we're expecting.
<br><br>So if you finally you've got that dotted line around it right click including Project blank back over
<br><br>here.
<br><br>So yeah including project and then it should change color and look the way it's supposed to.
<br><br>OK.
<br><br>So that's including the files particularly the scripts.
<br><br>Make sure that all your scripts are in the project because scripts is what we're editing in Visual Studio
<br><br>OK.
<br><br>Fifth point out of six points.
<br><br>Try updating Visual Studio.
<br><br>How do you do that.
<br><br>Well we go over to help and then help and let's see should be in here somewhere check for updates.
<br><br>So just as you would do with any software check for updates and make sure that you have the latest version
<br><br>of Visual Studio if nothing else has fixed it.
<br><br>And then also you can install and use a different version of Unity for example using Unity 2017 in part
<br><br>of this course we're also using Unity 2018.
<br><br>You could try updating to 2018 you could use 2019.
<br><br>So playing around with the version of Unity could solve your problems.
<br><br>So there's a checklist.
<br><br>Feel free to come back to this in the future if you do have problems.
<br><br>If you don't have problems.
<br><br>Excellent.
<br><br>Most people don't.
<br><br>But I wanted to make sure I got this video in early just in case you do.
<br><br>OK.
<br><br>Let's get back to continuing with our no wizard.
