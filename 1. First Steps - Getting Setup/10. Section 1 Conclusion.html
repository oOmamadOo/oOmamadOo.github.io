<br><br>Hey, well done getting to the end of the first section. 3
<br><br>So, hopefully you're feeling set up and 4
<br><br>you've had a very brief glimpse into Unity and Visual Studio now. 5
<br><br>There's lots and lots more to learn and we operate what we call a spiral syllabus. 6
<br><br>That means we'll be revisiting a lot of what you've learned again and 7
<br><br>again to deepen your knowledge. 8
<br><br>For example, you learned to set up simple block models, but 9
<br><br>we didn't talk about things like origins and where things should be starting from, 10
<br><br>and whether they're gonna scale and rotate properly. 11
<br><br>We didn't worry about that, 12
<br><br>because we wanted to keep it really simple for you, right? 13
<br><br>We just want you to get into the very basics. 14
<br><br>Having said that, we're gonna revisit all of this stuff again, and again and again. 15
<br><br>So the purpose of that section was simply to get you off the ground. 16
<br><br>Get your environment set up, get you to have a play, and 17
<br><br>hopefully you've already had a bit of fun. 18
<br><br>Also, I really hope that you're already engaging with our community, because 19
<br><br>there's so many people out there to help you, and we love to see you engage. 20
<br><br>So if so far you haven't done any of our community engagement challenges, 21
<br><br>please go ahead and do that. 22
<br><br>Please just go to at least one of the community sites we linked you to. 23
<br><br>The game dev community, community.gamedev.tv that is, or 24
<br><br>to our discord server there's an invite in one of the earlier lectures. 25
<br><br>Or you could go onto our Facebook group, or 26
<br><br>you could talk to us on Twitter, just engage, it would be great if you would. 27
<br><br>Anyway, thank you for finishing this section. 28
<br><br>I suggest you start the next one straight away, even if you haven't got time to 29
<br><br>do much of it, just to keep the momentum, and I'll see you in the next section.
