Hey guys so this is a casual instructor hang out with me and Rick Rick how are you doing. 1
<br><br>Good. 2
<br><br>Hello hi welcome. 3
<br><br>So what we do in these is approximately every quiz we going to look through the fall and we're going 4
<br><br>to look through the Q and A's and were going to find out what your questions are. 5
<br><br>Call out some of the best things you guys have created and discuss what you've done so far. 6
<br><br>So that's the idea of this this section. 7
<br><br>So Rick what have you got for them. 8
<br><br>Yes something that I see coming up a lot is the question of monodevelop versus Visual Studio 9
<br><br>at this stage. 10
<br><br>It's really interesting that it also falls out into a larger conversation about Mac versus PC. 11
<br><br>So on this course I represent the PC guys and been a lot more of a Mac fanboy. 12
<br><br>And really the point here is Unity doesn't care it so long as it's getting good honest C# 13
<br><br>code fed into it. 14
<br><br>And so long as it all makes sense to you guys then it doesn't matter whether you're a PC or a 15
<br><br>Mac guy. 16
<br><br>There are some very specific people asking about 17
<br><br>Well should I be doing using MonoDevelop. 18
<br><br>Can I use MonoDevelop. 19
<br><br>Should I use Visual Studio. 20
<br><br>So what do you recommend in terms of the actual system that we're using. 21
<br><br>Yes so I've I've used my PC over there which I love as well. 22
<br><br>For the first few lectures of the course because we recognize most of you are on PC. 23
<br><br>And then I switch on my Mac a little bit later on just because I'm more comfortable it's what I use 24
<br><br>every day now MonoDevelop versus visual studio doesn't really matter if you're being offered 25
<br><br>MonoDevelop you're very welcome to use it. 26
<br><br>Unity always used to ship with MonoDevelop. 27
<br><br>You'll see the word mono and mono behaviour come up all through a unity even today but it is now possible 28
<br><br>to use Visual Studio on both Mac NPC. 29
<br><br>So we have decided to show you that just for consistency so that all of you are looking at a very similar 30
<br><br>package. 31
<br><br>They all did the same thing they all write code yet they might use slightly different colours for this 32
<br><br>syntax highlighting. 33
<br><br>Yeah they might behave a little bit differently. 34
<br><br>And you don't even need to use one of these things you could use Notepad it's just really hard to write 35
<br><br>code when you're not getting any help with what code is available or with what or with how the indentation 36
<br><br>works or how or have a spacing work so it's worth using an idea an integrated development environment. 37
<br><br>And I recommend Visual Studio if you can get it going but it is fine as well. 38
<br><br>And you'll see there will be differences between the way that Ben has his grain's set up and I have 39
<br><br>my screen set up you'll see that I'm using a P.S. he's using a Mac. 40
<br><br>Well yeah he's been using both. 41
<br><br>So far n you'll have your set up the way you like it so you can start by using the way we've set ourselves 42
<br><br>up and following them. 43
<br><br>But after a while you'll start to see why I want this colour and I want this moved here and that window 44
<br><br>here and that window there so I should play around and do what works for you. 45
<br><br>Then I saw a pot and think it was Michael that was asking can we use Monte develops. 46
<br><br>Thanks for asking Michael Yes you can. 47
<br><br>Not a problem. 48
<br><br>By the way good time to say if you're an experienced shop coder you want to give you some idea of what's 49
<br><br>coming up so. 50
<br><br>This section has all been about installing your developing environment. 51
<br><br>Probably what you got that set up installing unity you may or may not have had that set up playing with 52
<br><br>unity which we'll talk about in a minute. 53
<br><br>But if you were pretty experience with C sharp you can safely skip terminal hack at the next section 54
<br><br>the next section is going to be all about getting in the fundamentals of C sharp and we're specifically 55
<br><br>not teaching you anything to do with unity in that section. 56
<br><br>It looks like we are because you create a pretty terminal game but the reality is we've engineered it 57
<br><br>for you so that you only deal in C Sharp. 58
<br><br>Nothing Unity's specific so it's just for a simple reason why waste. 59
<br><br>We're starting off with just diving straight into the code straining to scripting rather than saying 60
<br><br>let's play around and make something super visual and spend a lot of time on it. 61
<br><br>Good to get a little bit familiar with the unity interface which is what we'd been doing in this section 62
<br><br>is get your hands dirty. 63
<br><br>But really if you guys have come along here understand coding and coding practices and giving the foundations 64
<br><br>for that then this whole next section were about to dive into really covers a lot of that stuff. 65
<br><br>Absolutely and by the way if you want to I'm looking down I got a page full of notes here. 66
<br><br>All the things we want to say we're not trying to memorize that so that's why you see us looking denniss 67
<br><br>Casual video this one. 68
<br><br>So when we regularly update these videos we will be putting them throughout the whole course. 69
<br><br>As you guys ask more questions. 70
<br><br>As things change with unity as new things come along we'll jump back in and make sure this course is 71
<br><br>as relevant as possible for you guys and all of the questions that you ask. 72
<br><br>We read every single one of them and if it's something that we think everyone should know about then 73
<br><br>we put them in these particular videos. 74
<br><br>So you guys all know about it. 75
<br><br>Yeah absolutely. 76
<br><br>And you might see the video fade down and fade up will be in different clothes in a different time. 77
<br><br>That's because we're coming back and responding to your feedback. 78
<br><br>Now Ben talking about questions Dan asked a question about resetting transforms and how this works in 79
<br><br>the scene view. 80
<br><br>Look I just want to say at this very early stage in the course the purpose of you doing is block. 81
<br><br>Modelling is just to get an idea of how unity is laid out. 82
<br><br>We're not expecting you to be laying your models out properly with what we call pivot points in the 83
<br><br>right place or any of that stuff. 84
<br><br>We're just not worried yet it's just getting your hands on unity despite that look at some of the cool 85
<br><br>things people have done. 86
<br><br>So firstly thank you for introducing yourself so many introductions from around the world in the uder 87
<br><br>mcewen a thank you also for introducing yourself over on our community site. 88
<br><br>So amazing to see from all over the place. 89
<br><br>But when it comes to sharing your graphics those of you found out how to capture your screen if you 90
<br><br>haven't please work out a screen capture user the windows clipping tool on Windows 10 or find a way 91
<br><br>on the Mac and we use snag get it cost a bit of money but it's really good. 92
<br><br>But anyway look you're showing these things. 93
<br><br>Now some people will be doing very basic things. 94
<br><br>And some people are doing things that are amazing and beyond the scope of what you've learned so far. 95
<br><br>Like using trains and all sorts of clever stuff don't be put off by that. 96
<br><br>Just be inspired by it. 97
<br><br>These are just people have got a bit more unity experience but certainly don't stress over this too 98
<br><br>long. 99
<br><br>If you find yourself getting stuck and finding things are awkward just move on to the net. 100
<br><br>S. come back once you've learned more about how to assemble objects and parent transforms and reset 101
<br><br>positions and all that stuff don't stress over this. 102
<br><br>This is just for fun hey this is cool. 103
<br><br>Look at a look at Daniel guj is world here very bubbly. 104
<br><br>And I'd say as well that there's a lot of you out there who are getting very drawn towards the visual 105
<br><br>nature of unity in terms of you know placing things in the scene and building things and building your 106
<br><br>your cars and your whole world. 107
<br><br>That's really cool. 108
<br><br>Listen to that. 109
<br><br>Understand that that's what is attractive to you. 110
<br><br>And in my role throughout this course I'm going to be showing you guys how to turn what we're doing 111
<br><br>in this course into actual games into into designs good works for a product that you could watch. 112
<br><br>And I think when it comes to any development you can be very technical and be an excellent programmer 113
<br><br>but not interested in art. 114
<br><br>Not a problem. 115
<br><br>Or you can be a lot more art focussed and just have enough of the technical aspect to get your vision 116
<br><br>and your experience. 117
<br><br>Realize there's plenty of different approaches that you can take. 118
<br><br>You don't just have to be a programming wizard or you don't have to be an art expert. 119
<br><br>You can dance to your own showing and be successful as an indie game developer. 120
<br><br>Absolutely you can. 121
<br><br>You can create a role for yourself that makes you strong. 122
<br><br>If you're amazing with art make an hour heavy game if you're amazingly programming make a programming 123
<br><br>heavy game. 124
<br><br>Follow your passions but also understand as an indie that you are your chain is only as strong as its 125
<br><br>weakest link and if you're gonna work on your own and get a game out there you're going to have to know 126
<br><br>how to do some program even if you hate it and you going to have to have some sort of an eye for art 127
<br><br>and music and sound and all the rest of it. 128
<br><br>Even if you hate it so. 129
<br><br>Fill in the gaps in your knowledge or team up with somebody. 130
<br><br>And really and then play to your strengths right Rick and this course really does focus on the technical 131
<br><br>aspects so you've gotta get in there. 132
<br><br>You've really got to apply yourself. 133
<br><br>You're a bit worried about it good afraid of scripting and programming. 134
<br><br>Just throw yourself at it. 135
<br><br>Practice it. 136
<br><br>Get as good as you can at it because it's really really useful. 137
<br><br>Eat That Frog as we say right do that. 138
<br><br>The unpleasant thing first. 139
<br><br>This sounds disgusting. 140
<br><br>OK that's it. 141
<br><br>I think we're done with this hang up for now. 142
<br><br>Maybe more added onto the end of it later but we will see you next time. 143
<br><br>So you guys. 144
<br><br>See here.
