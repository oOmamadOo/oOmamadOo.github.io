[MUSIC] 2
<br><br>Hi and thanks for joining me on the course. 3
<br><br>Look, I'm gonna keep this intro super short, 4
<br><br>cuz I wanna get you downloading Unity and. Visual Studio. 5
<br><br>So that we can actually get in and start teaching you some things. 6
<br><br>We'll be doing that in the first video, then there'll be a little bit more general 7
<br><br>course introduction, and how to use the course, in the next video. 8
<br><br>So, without further ado, let's show you how to get that done, and 9
<br><br>I'll see you at the end of the section. 10
<br><br>In this video we're purely focused on getting Unity downloading. 11
<br><br>By the end of the video, Unity should just be downloading on your machine. 12
<br><br>If you've already got it you're welcome to skip forward. 13
<br><br>And if you're on a Mac, there are some extra instructions at the end of the video 14
<br><br>on how to get Visual Studio for Mac. 15
<br><br>If you're really lucky and you've got really fast broadband, 16
<br><br>you might get this far that the download has finished. 17
<br><br>Most of you are just aiming to get the download started. 18
<br><br>So, if you've already got Unity 2017.1.1 or later installed, and you're on a PC, 19
<br><br>you can just skip onto the next video where we'll welcome you to the course. 20
<br><br>If you haven't already got Unity 2017.1.1 installed, then this video is for you. 21
<br><br>Now, if you're on a Mac, by the way, you may have Unity 2017.1.1 or later. 22
<br><br>But you might not have Visual Studio. 23
<br><br>So, hang on, watch this video through until the end, 24
<br><br>where I'll show you how to get. Visual Studio for the Mac. 25
<br><br>All right, so, what we're gonna do is start off by throwing you straight into 26
<br><br>your first challenge. 27
<br><br>This course is all about taking action. 28
<br><br>And we give you specific challenges very regularly. 29
<br><br>This one's not super difficult, but it's really an exercise in just taking action. 30
<br><br>And also in showing you this challenge slide. 31
<br><br>So when you see a slide like this come up that is green all in the outside with 32
<br><br>a little pause symbol towards the bottom over here, then that's a challenge slide. 33
<br><br>Now what I want you to do as part of this challenge is just simply get 34
<br><br>Unity downloading. 35
<br><br>And the result of a challenge is that have. Unity 2017.1.1 installed or downloading. 36
<br><br>Soon as it's downloading please carry on to the next video. 37
<br><br>We've designed this early part of the course. 38
<br><br>So that you can be learning things that don't need Unity, 39
<br><br>while it's downloading in the background. 40
<br><br>You're gonna need to start with about 5GB of free disc space on a PC, 41
<br><br>on a Mac you're gonna need more like 10 to start with. 42
<br><br>If you've already got Unity installed, well our projects are gonna need 1.5, 2GB, 43
<br><br>something like that by the end of the course. 44
<br><br>So, you also need to make sure that you have the default install options. 45
<br><br>But frankly, don't worry too much cuz that can be changed later. 46
<br><br>So if you already got Unity installed, you're probably good to go. 47
<br><br>Just carry on and we can deal with any issues you have later. 48
<br><br>Talking about issues, if you have any problems, ask in the Q&amp;A. 49
<br><br>But please do us a favor and remember once you've solved your problem and 50
<br><br>you've got Unity downloading, then please remember to mark your answer as solved. 51
<br><br>Mark it as answered, so 52
<br><br>that other people don't try and help you when you're already fixed. 53
<br><br>So, first challenge. 54
<br><br>Go ahead, pause the video and get Unity 2017.1.1 downloading. 55
<br><br>Or, if you've already got it, well skip on to the next video. 56
<br><br>All right quick pause for breath to give you a chance to do that. 57
<br><br>Now, what happens with these challenges is firstly I ask you to do it and 58
<br><br>then I show you how I would do it. 59
<br><br>So I'm just gonna type into Google get Unity. 60
<br><br>And Unity download is there. 61
<br><br>You can see the URL, that might change slightly over time. 62
<br><br>so that's why I'm just googling to get Unity. 63
<br><br>Here we are at the download page. 64
<br><br>Now, a thing of note, you are very welcome to use the latest version of Unity. 65
<br><br>As you saw on the starting slide, we are on Unity 2017.1.1. 66
<br><br>Go ahead at this time and get the latest version, 67
<br><br>it doesn't matter if it's much later. 68
<br><br>But if you are having problems, just remember you could always come back to 69
<br><br>Unity's download pages and find older versions of Unity like this. 70
<br><br>They'll have a catalog which will have more versions in it by the time you 71
<br><br>watch this video. 72
<br><br>Anyway, for now, what we're doing. 73
<br><br>If you're starting afresh, is you're just choosing Unity. 74
<br><br>We're gonna use the personal version. 75
<br><br>It's free to use until you hit $100,000 of revenue. 76
<br><br>You can read their licensing. 77
<br><br>But if you're just starting out and trying this, don't even worry about any of that. 78
<br><br>Just go get the free version of Unity. 79
<br><br>Do read their terms of service, or at least have a browse at them. 80
<br><br>You can see here them talking about these gross revenues and 81
<br><br>then, you can just download the installer. 82
<br><br>So, that is the installer downloading. 83
<br><br>Now, this is a two part process. 84
<br><br>You get the installer, you go through the standard Windowsy stuff. 85
<br><br>You're just gonna clear,. I'm just gonna click through next, 86
<br><br>I'm gonna accept the terms of the agreement. 87
<br><br>I'm gonna leave these install options as standard. 88
<br><br>If you're on a Mac, you're going to see no Visual Studio 2017, that's not 89
<br><br>gonna be there on a Mac, because you have to download it separately. 90
<br><br>Leave it in this place if you want, unless you particularly want to store multiple 91
<br><br>versions of Unity, then you can just give your folder a different name. 92
<br><br>But in this case,. I'm just going to go with default. 93
<br><br>So everything I've just clicked through has been default. 94
<br><br>I have just accepted and gone, next, next, next, 95
<br><br>that's why I went through it quickly. 96
<br><br>Now, this is downloading Unity now, so as I said, its a two stage process. 97
<br><br>So if you get this far, you've succeeded in the challenge. 98
<br><br>And if you're in a PC or on a PC, then hopefully you're not in a PC, 99
<br><br>then you're done. 100
<br><br>Just skip on to the next video. 101
<br><br>If you're on a Mac, let's talk of what we need to do on the Mac. 102
<br><br>Okay then, Mac people, here we are again back at my Mac. 103
<br><br>So shh, don't tell the PC people but. I actually slightly prefer using a Mac. 104
<br><br>Anyway I'm gonna be starting this course off on PC because most 105
<br><br>people frankly at the moment who are taking the course will be using a PC. 106
<br><br>Although now that Apple support, VR, and AR, maybe that trend will change. 107
<br><br>But PCs are much more flexible and affordable. 108
<br><br>So six of one and half a dozen of another, as we say. 109
<br><br>Anyway, that'll be all of the Mac vs PC spiel for the entire course with any luck. 110
<br><br>Apart from maybe the odd nugget dropped in here and there. 111
<br><br>So, what do we do on the Mac that's different? 112
<br><br>Well hopefully Unity is already downloading for you. 113
<br><br>And it'll be coming with something called mono-develop. 114
<br><br>That's currently, at the time of recording, 115
<br><br>the IDE integrated development environment that is bundled with Unity. 116
<br><br>But I am gonna to be using Visual Studio in the course, both on PC and Mac. 117
<br><br>So we wanna get hold of Visual Studio. 118
<br><br>Your challenge, therefore, is to get. Visual Studio for Mac downloading. 119
<br><br>It's only necessary if you're on MacOS. 120
<br><br>If you're on PC, why are you watching? 121
<br><br>Apart to hear my opinion about PCs. 122
<br><br>If you're on PC, 123
<br><br>just dive onto the next video because you really don't need to watch this. 124
<br><br>Anyway, on Mac use the default install options and don't try and 125
<br><br>link Unity to Visual Studio yet. 126
<br><br>Unless you really wanna challenge, don't expect to work just get it downloading. 127
<br><br>The idea of this is that you watch the next video or 128
<br><br>so, whilst things are downloading in the background. 129
<br><br>So go ahead, see if you can get. Visual Studio for Mac downloading. 130
<br><br>All right, so again, 131
<br><br>the way these challenges work is I get you to get the challenge done. 132
<br><br>The starting of the download is the challenge spec in this case. 133
<br><br>Now I'm gonna come in and show you how I would get exactly the same thing done. 134
<br><br>You don't have to do things exactly the same way that I do. 135
<br><br>But it gives you, at least you can see how I end up doing things. 136
<br><br>So we can open another window of Google Chrome, like so. 137
<br><br>I'm gonna say something like get Unity, 138
<br><br>sorry, Visual Studio Mac, like so. 139
<br><br>And then, we're gonna look for. Visual Studio for Mac. 140
<br><br>And, again, it's a two step process. 141
<br><br>The first part of the process is that you download this installer. 142
<br><br>Now the pages may look a little bit different when you get to them. 143
<br><br>I'm not gonna update the course every five minutes to reflect this cuz this is 144
<br><br>simple stuff. 145
<br><br>And we can flow with that. 146
<br><br>The concept is you want Visual Studio for. Mac and that's installing. 147
<br><br>When the installer comes down then we simply need to run the DMG of course 148
<br><br>as per user on a Mac. 149
<br><br>It'll open that up, which is a disk image, and it will open the installer. 150
<br><br>There you go, install Visual Studio. 151
<br><br>And it is on it's way, so we'll just leave it doing that. 152
<br><br>If you got as far as saying, okay, 153
<br><br>it's okay to install this even though it's a third party. 154
<br><br>If you've got as far as checking your Internet connection and 155
<br><br>the download is actually running, then that's all you need to do. 156
<br><br>So I'll just see this through to its logical conclusion. 157
<br><br>Thank you for downloading Visual Studio. 158
<br><br>That's fine. 159
<br><br>I'm just gonna leave all the default selections. 160
<br><br>And, in my case,. I have nothing to install or 161
<br><br>update because I already have Visual Studio on here. 162
<br><br>You may be in that position. 163
<br><br>You may not. 164
<br><br>Otherwise, just leave these settings as default and 165
<br><br>let the install start happening. 166
<br><br>It's gonna be a reasonable sized download. 167
<br><br>And just leave it doing that for now. 168
<br><br>That's all we need to do. 169
<br><br>Okay, I will see you in the next video.
